forward	1
to	1
the	1
platform	1
with	1
a	1
hesitancy	1

embarrassment	1
necessarily	1
the	1
attendants	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
mind	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
novel	1
position	1
after	1
apologizing	1
for	1
his	1
ignorance	1
and	1
reminding	1
the	1
audience	1
that	1
slavery	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
school	1
for	1
the	1
human	1
intellect	1

heart	1

proceeded	1
to	1
narrate	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
history	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
speech	1
gave	1
utterance	1
to	1
many	1
noble	1
thoughts	1

thrilling	1
reflections	1

as	1
he	1

taken	1
his	1
seat	1
filled	1

hope	1
and	1
admiration	1
i	1
rose	1

declared	1
that	1
patrick	1
henry	1
of	1
revolutionary	1
fame	1
never	1
made	1
a	1
speech	1
more	1
eloquent	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
liberty	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
listened	1
to	1
from	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
that	1
hunted	1
fugitive	1
so	1
i	1
believed	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
such	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
now	1
i	1
reminded	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
peril	1
which	1
surrounded	1
this	1
self	1
emancipated	1
young	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
even	1
in	1
massachusetts	1
on	1
the	1
soil	1
of	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
fathers	1
among	1
the	1
descendants	1
of	1
revolutionary	1
sires	1
and	1
i	1
appealed	1
to	1
them	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
ever	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
back	1
into	1
slavery	1
law	1
or	1
no	1
law	1
constitution	1
or	1
no	1
constitution	1
the	1
response	1
was	1
unanimous	1
and	1
in	1
thunder	1
tones	1
no	1
will	1
you	1
succor	1
and	1
protect	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1

a	1
resident	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
bay	1
state	1
yes	1
shouted	1
the	1
whole	1
mass	1
with	1
an	1
energy	1
so	1
startling	1
that	1
the	1
ruthless	1
tyrants	1
south	1
of	1
mason	1
and	1
dixon	1
s	1
line	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
mighty	1
burst	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
recognized	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
pledge	1
of	1
an	1
invincible	1
determination	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
gave	1
it	1
never	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
that	1
wanders	1
but	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
outcast	1
and	1
firmly	1
to	1
abide	1
the	1
consequences	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
mr	1
douglass	1
could	1
be	1
persuaded	1
to	1
consecrate	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
talents	1
to	1
the	1
promotion	1
of	1
the	1
anti	1
slavery	1
enterprise	1
a	1
powerful	1
impetus	1
would	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
stunning	1
blow	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
inflicted	1
on	1
northern	1
prejudice	1
against	1
a	1
colored	1
complexion	1
i	1
therefore	1
endeavored	1
to	1
instil	1
hope	1
and	1
courage	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
dare	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
a	1
vocation	1
so	1
anomalous	1
and	1
responsible	1
for	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
his	1
situation	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
seconded	1
in	1
this	1
effort	1
by	1
warm	1
hearted	1
friends	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
late	1
general	1
agent	1
of	1
the	1
massachusetts	1
anti	1
slavery	1
society	1
mr	1
john	1
a	1
collins	1
whose	1
judgment	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
entirely	1
coincided	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
encouragement	1
with	1
unfeigned	1
diffidence	1
he	1
expressed	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
adequate	1
to	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
task	1
the	1
path	1
marked	1
out	1
was	1
wholly	1
an	1
untrodden	1
one	1
he	1
was	1
sincerely	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
good	1
after	1
much	1
deliberation	1
however	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
trial	1
and	1
ever	1
since	1
that	1
period	1
he	1
has	1
acted	1
as	1
a	1
lecturing	1
agent	1
under	1
the	1
auspices	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
american	1
or	1
the	1
massachusetts	1
anti	1
slavery	1
society	1
in	1
labors	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
most	1
abundant	1
and	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
combating	1
prejudice	1
in	1
gaining	1
proselytes	1
in	1
agitating	1
the	1
public	1
mind	1
has	1
far	1
surpassed	1
the	1
most	1
sanguine	1
expectations	1
that	1
were	1
raised	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
brilliant	1
career	1
he	1
has	1
borne	1
himself	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
meekness	1
yet	1
with	1
true	1
manliness	1
of	1
character	1
as	1
a	1
public	1
speaker	1
he	1
excels	1
in	1
pathos	1
wit	1
comparison	1
imitation	1
strength	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
fluency	1
of	1
language	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
union	1
of	1
head	1
and	1
heart	1
which	1
is	1
indispensable	1
to	1
an	1
enlightenment	1
of	1
the	1
heads	1
and	1
a	1
winning	1
of	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
others	1
may	1
his	1
strength	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
his	1
day	1
may	1
he	1
continue	1
to	1
grow	1
in	1
grace	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
god	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
increasingly	1
serviceable	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
bleeding	1
humanity	1
whether	1
at	1
home	1
or	1
abroad	1
it	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
fact	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
efficient	1
advocates	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
population	1
now	1
before	1
the	1
public	1
is	1
a	1
fugitive	1
slave	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
frederick	1
douglass	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
free	1
colored	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
are	1
as	1
ably	1
represented	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
number	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
charles	1
lenox	1
remond	1
whose	1
eloquent	1
appeals	1
have	1
extorted	1
the	1
highest	1
applause	1
of	1
multitudes	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
atlantic	1
let	1
the	1
calumniators	1
of	1
the	1
colored	1
race	1
despise	1
themselves	1
for	1
their	1
baseness	1
and	1
illiberality	1
of	1
spirit	1
and	1
henceforth	1
cease	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
inferiority	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
require	1
nothing	1
but	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
to	1
attain	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
human	1
excellence	1
it	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
fairly	1
questioned	1
whether	1
any	1
other	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
could	1
have	1
endured	1
the	1
privations	1
sufferings	1
and	1
horrors	1
of	1
slavery	1
without	1
having	1
become	1
more	1
degraded	1
in	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
humanity	1
than	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
african	1
descent	1
nothing	1
has	1
been	1
left	1
undone	1
to	1
cripple	1
their	1
intellects	1
darken	1
their	1
minds	1
debase	1
their	1
moral	1
nature	1
obliterate	1
all	1
traces	1
of	1
their	1
relationship	1
to	1
mankind	1
and	1
yet	1
how	1
wonderfully	1
they	1
have	1
sustained	1
the	1
mighty	1
load	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
frightful	1
bondage	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
groaning	1
for	1
centuries	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
slavery	1
on	1
the	1
white	1

show	1
that	1

even	1
in	1

not	1

that	1
the	1

held	1
as	1

that	1

no	1
idea	1
of	1
injustice	1

wholesale	1
misstatements	1

abominable	1

on	1
the	1

all	1
these	1
direful	1
outrages	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
natural	1
results	1
of	1
slavery	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
less	1
cruel	1
to	1
reduce	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
than	1
to	1
give	1

a	1
severe	1
flagellation	1

to	1
deprive	1

the	1

when	1
absolute	1
power	1
is	1
assumed	1
over	1

skeptics	1
of	1
this	1
character	1
abound	1
in	1

in	1
some	1
few	1
instances	1
their	1
incredulity	1
arises	1
from	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
reflection	1
but	1
generally	1
it	1
indicates	1
a	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
shield	1
slavery	1
from	1
the	1
assaults	1
of	1
its	1
foes	1
a	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
colored	1
race	1
whether	1

will	1
try	1
to	1
discredit	1
the	1
shocking	1
tales	1
of	1
slaveholding	1
cruelty	1
which	1
are	1
recorded	1
in	1
this	1
truthful	1
narrative	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
labor	1
in	1
vain	1
mr	1
douglass	1
has	1
frankly	1
disclosed	1
the	1
place	1
of	1

the	1

of	1
those	1

two	1
instances	1
of	1
murderous	1

one	1

which	1
a	1

deliberately	1
shot	1
a	1

my	1
dear	1
friend	1
you	1
remember	1
the	1
old	1
fable	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
where	1
the	1
lion	1
complained	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
misrepresented	1
when	1
the	1
lions	1
wrote	1
history	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
when	1
the	1
lions	1
write	1
history	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
left	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
slavery	1
from	1
the	1
involuntary	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
masters	1
one	1
might	1
indeed	1
rest	1
sufficiently	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
general	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
relation	1
without	1
seeking	1
farther	1
to	1
find	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
followed	1
in	1
every	1
instance	1
indeed	1
those	1
who	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
half	1
peck	1
of	1
corn	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
love	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
lashes	1
on	1
the	1
slave	1
s	1
back	1
are	1
seldom	1
the	1
stuff	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
reformers	1
and	1
abolitionists	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
i	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
1838	1
many	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
india	1
experiment	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
ranks	1
those	1
results	1
have	1
come	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
alas	1
few	1
of	1
that	1
number	1
have	1
come	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
converts	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
emancipation	1
by	1
other	1
tests	1
than	1
whether	1
it	1
has	1
increased	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
sugar	1
and	1
to	1
hate	1
slavery	1
for	1
other	1
reasons	1
than	1
because	1
it	1
starves	1
men	1
and	1
whips	1
women	1
before	1
he	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
first	1
stone	1
of	1
his	1
anti	1
slavery	1
life	1
i	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
learn	1
in	1
your	1
story	1
how	1
early	1
the	1
most	1
neglected	1
of	1
god	1
s	1
children	1
waken	1
to	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
done	1
them	1
experience	1
is	1
a	1
keen	1
teacher	1
and	1
long	1
before	1
you	1
had	1
mastered	1
your	1
a	1
b	1
c	1
or	1
knew	1
where	1
the	1
white	1
sails	1
of	1
the	1
chesapeake	1
were	1
bound	1
you	1
began	1
i	1
see	1
to	1
gauge	1
the	1
wretchedness	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
hunger	1
and	1
want	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
lashes	1
and	1
toil	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
cruel	1
and	1
blighting	1
death	1
which	1
gathers	1
over	1
his	1
soul	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
circumstance	1
which	1
makes	1
your	1
recollections	1
peculiarly	1
valuable	1
and	1
renders	1
your	1
early	1
insight	1
the	1
more	1
remarkable	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
slavery	1
appears	1
with	1
its	1
fairest	1
features	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
then	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
its	1
best	1
estate	1
gaze	1
on	1
its	1
bright	1
side	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
imagination	1
may	1
task	1
her	1
powers	1
to	1
add	1
dark	1
lines	1
to	1
the	1
picture	1
as	1
she	1
travels	1
southward	1
to	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
colored	1
man	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
where	1
the	1
mississippi	1
sweeps	1
along	1
again	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
long	1
and	1
can	1
put	1
the	1
most	1
entire	1
confidence	1
in	1
your	1
truth	1
candor	1
and	1
sincerity	1
every	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
heard	1
you	1
speak	1
has	1
felt	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
confident	1
every	1
one	1
who	1
reads	1
your	1
book	1
will	1
feel	1
persuaded	1
that	1
you	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
fair	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
no	1
one	1
sided	1
portrait	1
no	1
wholesale	1
complaints	1
but	1
strict	1
justice	1
done	1
whenever	1
individual	1
kindliness	1
has	1
neutralized	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
deadly	1
system	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
strangely	1
allied	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
us	1
too	1
some	1
years	1
and	1
can	1
fairly	1
compare	1
the	1
twilight	1
of	1
rights	1
which	1
your	1
race	1
enjoy	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
with	1
that	1
noon	1
of	1
night	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
labor	1
south	1
of	1
mason	1
and	1
dixon	1
s	1
line	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
half	1
free	1
colored	1
man	1
of	1
massachusetts	1
is	1
worse	1
off	1
than	1
the	1
pampered	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
rice	1
swamps	1
in	1
reading	1
your	1
life	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
unfairly	1
picked	1
out	1
some	1
rare	1
specimens	1
of	1
cruelty	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
bitter	1
drops	1
which	1
even	1
you	1
have	1
drained	1
from	1
the	1
cup	1
are	1
no	1
incidental	1
aggravations	1
no	1
individual	1
ills	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
must	1
mingle	1
always	1
and	1
necessarily	1
in	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
every	1
slave	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
essential	1
ingredients	1
not	1
the	1
occasional	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
after	1
all	1
i	1
shall	1
read	1
your	1
book	1
with	1
trembling	1
for	1
you	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
real	1
name	1
and	1
birthplace	1
you	1
may	1
remember	1
i	1
stopped	1
you	1
and	1
preferred	1
to	1
remain	1
ignorant	1
of	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
a	1
vague	1
description	1
so	1
i	1
continued	1
till	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
when	1
you	1
read	1
me	1
your	1
memoirs	1
i	1
hardly	1
knew	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
whether	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
or	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
dangerous	1
in	1
massachusetts	1
for	1
honest	1
men	1
to	1
tell	1
their	1
names	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
fathers	1
in	1
1776	1
signed	1
the	1
declaration	1
of	1
independence	1
with	1
the	1
halter	1
about	1
their	1
necks	1
you	1
too	1
publish	1
your	1
declaration	1
of	1
freedom	1
with	1
danger	1
compassing	1
you	1
around	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
broad	1
lands	1
which	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
overshadows	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
single	1
spot	1
however	1
narrow	1
or	1
desolate	1
where	1
a	1
fugitive	1
slave	1
can	1
plant	1
himself	1
and	1
say	1
i	1
am	1
safe	1
the	1
whole	1
armory	1
of	1
northern	1
law	1
has	1
no	1
shield	1
for	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
free	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
your	1
place	1
i	1
should	1
throw	1
the	1
ms	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
you	1
perhaps	1
may	1
tell	1
your	1
story	1
in	1
safety	1
endeared	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
so	1
many	1
warm	1
hearts	1
by	1
rare	1
gifts	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
rarer	1
devotion	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
others	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
owing	1
only	1
to	1
your	1
labors	1
and	1
the	1
fearless	1
efforts	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
trampling	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
under	1
their	1
feet	1
are	1
determined	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
hide	1
the	1
outcast	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
hearths	1
shall	1
be	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
the	1
oppressed	1
if	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
the	1
humblest	1
may	1
stand	1
in	1
our	1
streets	1
and	1
bear	1
witness	1
in	1
safety	1
against	1
the	1
cruelties	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
victim	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
sad	1
to	1
think	1
that	1

hearts	1
which	1
welcome	1
your	1

he	1
knew	1
that	1

1818	1

numerous	1
persons	1
doubted	1

was	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
unhappiness	1
to	1
me	1
even	1
during	1
childhood	1
the	1
white	1
children	1
could	1
tell	1
their	1
ages	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
why	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
privilege	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
inquiries	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
concerning	1
it	1
he	1
deemed	1
all	1
such	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
slave	1
improper	1
and	1
impertinent	1
and	1
evidence	1
of	1
a	1
restless	1
spirit	1
the	1
nearest	1
estimate	1
i	1
can	1
give	1
makes	1
me	1
now	1
between	1
twenty	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty	1
eight	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
i	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
from	1
hearing	1
my	1
master	1
say	1
some	1
time	1
during	1
1835	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
seventeen	1
years	1
old	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
named	1
harriet	1
bailey	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
isaac	1
and	1
betsey	1
bailey	1
both	1
colored	1
and	1
quite	1
dark	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
darker	1
complexion	1
than	1
either	1
my	1
grandmother	1
or	1
grandfather	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
by	1
all	1
i	1
ever	1
heard	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
parentage	1
the	1
opinion	1
was	1
also	1
whispered	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
was	1
my	1
father	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
correctness	1
of	1
this	1
opinion	1
i	1
know	1
nothing	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
knowing	1
was	1
withheld	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
i	1
were	1
separated	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
infant	1
before	1
i	1
knew	1
her	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
custom	1
in	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
maryland	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
ran	1
away	1
to	1
part	1
children	1
from	1
their	1
mothers	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
age	1
frequently	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
has	1
reached	1
its	1
twelfth	1
month	1
its	1
mother	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
hired	1
out	1
on	1
some	1
farm	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
off	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
placed	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
too	1
old	1
for	1
field	1
labor	1
for	1
what	1
this	1
separation	1
is	1
done	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
affection	1
toward	1
its	1
mother	1
and	1
to	1
blunt	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
natural	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
inevitable	1
result	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
as	1
such	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
times	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
times	1
was	1
very	1
short	1
in	1
duration	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
she	1
was	1
hired	1
by	1
a	1
mr	1
stewart	1
who	1
lived	1
about	1
twelve	1
miles	1
from	1
my	1
home	1
she	1
made	1
her	1
journeys	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
travelling	1
the	1
whole	1
distance	1
on	1
foot	1
after	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
her	1
day	1
s	1
work	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
field	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
whipping	1
is	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
sunrise	1
unless	1
a	1
slave	1
has	1
special	1
permission	1
from	1
his	1
or	1
her	1
master	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
a	1
permission	1
which	1
they	1
seldom	1
get	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
gives	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
gives	1
it	1
the	1
proud	1
name	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
kind	1
master	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
recollect	1
of	1
ever	1
seeing	1
my	1
mother	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
would	1
lie	1
down	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
get	1
me	1
to	1
sleep	1
but	1
long	1
before	1
i	1
waked	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
very	1
little	1
communication	1
ever	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
us	1
death	1
soon	1
ended	1
what	1
little	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
while	1
she	1
lived	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
her	1
hardships	1
and	1
suffering	1
she	1
died	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
seven	1
years	1
old	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
s	1
farms	1
near	1
lee	1
s	1
mill	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
during	1
her	1
illness	1
at	1
her	1
death	1
or	1
burial	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
long	1
before	1
i	1
knew	1
any	1
thing	1
about	1
it	1
never	1
having	1
enjoyed	1
to	1
any	1
considerable	1
extent	1
her	1
soothing	1
presence	1
her	1
tender	1
and	1
watchful	1
care	1
i	1
received	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
with	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
emotions	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
probably	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
stranger	1
called	1
thus	1
suddenly	1
away	1
she	1
left	1
me	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
intimation	1
of	1
who	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
the	1
whisper	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
was	1
my	1
father	1
may	1
or	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
true	1
and	1
true	1
or	1
false	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
but	1
little	1
consequence	1
to	1
my	1
purpose	1
whilst	1
the	1
fact	1
remains	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
glaring	1
odiousness	1
that	1
slaveholders	1
have	1
ordained	1
and	1
by	1
law	1
established	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
slave	1
women	1
shall	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
follow	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
their	1
mothers	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
too	1
obviously	1
to	1
administer	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
lusts	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
gratification	1
of	1
their	1
wicked	1
desires	1
profitable	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
pleasurable	1
for	1
by	1
this	1
cunning	1
arrangement	1
the	1
slaveholder	1
in	1
cases	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
sustains	1
to	1
his	1
slaves	1
the	1
double	1
relation	1
of	1
master	1
and	1
father	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
such	1
cases	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
remark	1
that	1
such	1
slaves	1
invariably	1
suffer	1
greater	1
hardships	1
and	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
than	1
others	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
a	1
constant	1
offence	1
to	1
their	1
mistress	1
she	1
is	1
ever	1
disposed	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
can	1
seldom	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
please	1
her	1
she	1
is	1
never	1
better	1
pleased	1
than	1
when	1
she	1
sees	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
lash	1
especially	1
when	1
she	1
suspects	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
showing	1
to	1
his	1
mulatto	1
children	1
favors	1
which	1
he	1
withholds	1
from	1
his	1
black	1
slaves	1
the	1
master	1
is	1
frequently	1
compelled	1
to	1
sell	1
this	1
class	1
of	1
his	1
slaves	1
out	1
of	1
deference	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
wife	1
and	1
cruel	1
as	1
the	1
deed	1
may	1
strike	1
any	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
own	1
children	1
to	1
human	1
flesh	1
mongers	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
dictate	1
of	1
humanity	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
for	1
unless	1
he	1
does	1
this	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
only	1
whip	1
them	1
himself	1
but	1
must	1
stand	1
by	1
and	1
see	1
one	1
white	1
son	1
tie	1
up	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
but	1
few	1
shades	1
darker	1
complexion	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
ply	1
the	1
gory	1
lash	1
to	1
his	1
naked	1
back	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
lisp	1
one	1
word	1
of	1
disapproval	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
parental	1
partiality	1
and	1
only	1
makes	1
a	1
bad	1
matter	1
worse	1
both	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
slave	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
protect	1
and	1
defend	1
every	1
year	1
brings	1
with	1
it	1
multitudes	1
of	1
this	1
class	1
of	1
slaves	1
it	1
was	1
doubtless	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
that	1
one	1
great	1
statesman	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
predicted	1
the	1
downfall	1
of	1
slavery	1
by	1
the	1
inevitable	1
laws	1
of	1
population	1
whether	1
this	1
prophecy	1
is	1
ever	1
fulfilled	1
or	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
nevertheless	1
plain	1
that	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
looking	1
class	1
of	1
people	1
are	1
springing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
held	1
in	1
slavery	1
from	1
those	1
originally	1
brought	1
to	1
this	1
country	1
from	1
africa	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
increase	1
do	1
no	1
other	1
good	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
away	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
argument	1
that	1
god	1
cursed	1
ham	1
and	1
therefore	1
american	1
slavery	1
is	1
right	1
if	1
the	1
lineal	1
descendants	1
of	1
ham	1
are	1
alone	1
to	1
be	1
scripturally	1
enslaved	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
slavery	1
at	1
the	1
south	1
must	1
soon	1
become	1
unscriptural	1
for	1
thousands	1
are	1
ushered	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
annually	1
who	1
like	1
myself	1
owe	1
their	1
existence	1
to	1
white	1
fathers	1
and	1
those	1
fathers	1
most	1
frequently	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
two	1
masters	1
my	1
first	1
master	1
s	1
name	1
was	1
anthony	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
his	1
first	1
name	1
he	1
was	1
generally	1
called	1
captain	1
anthony	1
a	1
title	1
which	1
i	1
presume	1
he	1
acquired	1
by	1
sailing	1
a	1
craft	1
on	1
the	1
chesapeake	1
bay	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
considered	1
a	1
rich	1
slaveholder	1
he	1
owned	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
farms	1
and	1
about	1
thirty	1
slaves	1
his	1
farms	1
and	1
slaves	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
an	1
overseer	1
the	1
overseer	1
s	1
name	1
was	1
plummer	1
mr	1
plummer	1
was	1
a	1
miserable	1
drunkard	1
a	1
profane	1
swearer	1
and	1
a	1
savage	1
monster	1
he	1
always	1
went	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
cowskin	1
and	1
a	1
heavy	1
cudgel	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
cut	1
and	1
slash	1
the	1
women	1
s	1
heads	1
so	1
horribly	1
that	1
even	1
master	1
would	1
be	1
enraged	1
at	1
his	1
cruelty	1
and	1
would	1
threaten	1
to	1
whip	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
himself	1
master	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
humane	1
slaveholder	1
it	1
required	1
extraordinary	1
barbarity	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
overseer	1
to	1
affect	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
cruel	1
man	1
hardened	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
of	1
slaveholding	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
times	1
seem	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
whipping	1
a	1
slave	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
been	1
awakened	1
at	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
heart	1
rending	1
shrieks	1
of	1
an	1
own	1
aunt	1
of	1
mine	1
whom	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
tie	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
joist	1
and	1
whip	1
upon	1
her	1
naked	1
back	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
literally	1
covered	1
with	1
blood	1
no	1
words	1
no	1
tears	1
no	1
prayers	1
from	1
his	1
gory	1
victim	1
seemed	1
to	1
move	1
his	1
iron	1
heart	1
from	1
its	1
bloody	1
purpose	1
the	1
louder	1
she	1
screamed	1
the	1
harder	1
he	1
whipped	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
blood	1
ran	1
fastest	1
there	1
he	1
whipped	1
longest	1
he	1
would	1
whip	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
scream	1
and	1
whip	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
hush	1
and	1
not	1
until	1
overcome	1
by	1
fatigue	1
would	1
he	1
cease	1
to	1
swing	1
the	1
blood	1
clotted	1
cowskin	1
i	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
ever	1
witnessed	1
this	1
horrible	1
exhibition	1
i	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
child	1
but	1
i	1
well	1
remember	1
it	1
i	1
never	1
shall	1
forget	1
it	1
whilst	1
i	1
remember	1
any	1
thing	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
such	1
outrages	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
doomed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
and	1
a	1
participant	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
with	1
awful	1
force	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
blood	1
stained	1
gate	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
hell	1
of	1
slavery	1
through	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
terrible	1
spectacle	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
commit	1
to	1
paper	1
the	1
feelings	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
beheld	1
it	1
this	1
occurrence	1
took	1
place	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
following	1
circumstances	1
aunt	1
hester	1
went	1
out	1
one	1
night	1
where	1
or	1
for	1
what	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
when	1
my	1
master	1
desired	1
her	1
presence	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
evenings	1
and	1
warned	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
never	1
let	1
him	1
catch	1
her	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
paying	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
belonging	1
to	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
s	1
name	1
was	1
ned	1
roberts	1
generally	1
called	1
lloyd	1
s	1
ned	1
why	1
master	1
was	1
so	1
careful	1
of	1
her	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
left	1
to	1
conjecture	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
noble	1
form	1
and	1
of	1
graceful	1
proportions	1
having	1
very	1
few	1
equals	1
and	1
fewer	1
superiors	1
in	1
personal	1
appearance	1
among	1
the	1
colored	1
or	1
white	1
women	1
of	1
our	1
neighborhood	1
aunt	1

it	1

were	1
peculiarly	1
enthusiastic	1
while	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
dense	1
old	1
woods	1
for	1
miles	1
around	1
reverberate	1
with	1
their	1
wild	1
songs	1
revealing	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
highest	1
joy	1
and	1
the	1
deepest	1
sadness	1
they	1
would	1
compose	1
and	1
sing	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
consulting	1
neither	1
time	1
nor	1
tune	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
came	1
out	1
if	1
not	1
in	1

as	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
as	1
in	1
the	1

would	1
sometimes	1
sing	1
the	1
most	1

sentiment	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
rapturous	1
tone	1
and	1

sentiment	1
in	1

tone	1
into	1
all	1

songs	1
they	1
would	1
manage	1
to	1
weave	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
farm	1
especially	1
would	1
they	1
do	1
this	1
when	1
leaving	1
home	1
they	1
would	1
then	1
sing	1
most	1
exultingly	1
the	1
following	1
words	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
farm	1
o	1
yea	1
o	1
yea	1
o	1
this	1
they	1
would	1
sing	1
as	1
a	1
chorus	1
to	1
words	1
which	1
to	1
many	1
would	1
seem	1
unmeaning	1
jargon	1
but	1
which	1
nevertheless	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
meaning	1
to	1
themselves	1
i	1
have	1
sometimes	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
mere	1
hearing	1
of	1
those	1
songs	1
would	1
do	1
more	1
to	1
impress	1
some	1
minds	1
with	1
the	1
horrible	1
character	1
of	1
slavery	1
than	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
whole	1
volumes	1
of	1
philosophy	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
could	1
do	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
when	1
a	1
slave	1
understand	1
the	1
deep	1
meaning	1
of	1
those	1
rude	1
and	1
apparently	1
incoherent	1
songs	1
i	1
was	1
myself	1
within	1
the	1
circle	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
neither	1
saw	1
nor	1
heard	1
as	1
those	1
without	1
might	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
they	1
told	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
woe	1
which	1
was	1
then	1
altogether	1
beyond	1
my	1
feeble	1
comprehension	1
they	1
were	1
tones	1
loud	1
long	1
and	1
deep	1
they	1
breathed	1
the	1
prayer	1
and	1
complaint	1
of	1
souls	1
boiling	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
bitterest	1
anguish	1
every	1
tone	1
was	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
slavery	1
and	1
a	1
prayer	1
to	1
god	1
for	1
deliverance	1
from	1
chains	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
those	1
wild	1
notes	1
always	1
depressed	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
ineffable	1
sadness	1
i	1
have	1
frequently	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
tears	1
while	1
hearing	1
them	1
the	1
mere	1
recurrence	1
to	1
those	1
songs	1
even	1
now	1
afflicts	1
me	1
and	1
while	1
i	1
am	1
writing	1
these	1
lines	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
feeling	1
has	1
already	1
found	1
its	1
way	1
down	1
my	1
cheek	1
to	1
those	1
songs	1
i	1
trace	1
my	1
first	1
glimmering	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
dehumanizing	1
character	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
can	1
never	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
conception	1
those	1
songs	1
still	1
follow	1
me	1
to	1
deepen	1
my	1
hatred	1
of	1
slavery	1
and	1
quicken	1
my	1
sympathies	1
for	1
my	1
brethren	1
in	1
bonds	1
if	1
any	1
one	1
wishes	1
to	1
be	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
soul	1
killing	1
effects	1
of	1
slavery	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
to	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1

plantation	1
and	1
on	1
allowance	1
day	1
place	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
pine	1
woods	1
and	1
there	1
let	1
him	1
in	1
silence	1
analyze	1
the	1
sounds	1
that	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
thus	1
impressed	1
it	1
will	1
only	1
be	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
flesh	1
in	1
his	1
obdurate	1
heart	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
been	1
utterly	1
astonished	1
since	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
find	1
persons	1
who	1
could	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
among	1
slaves	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
their	1
contentment	1
and	1
happiness	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
conceive	1
of	1
a	1
greater	1
mistake	1
slaves	1
sing	1
most	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
most	1
unhappy	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
represent	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
relieved	1
by	1
them	1
only	1
as	1
an	1
aching	1
heart	1
is	1
relieved	1
by	1
its	1
tears	1
at	1
least	1
such	1
is	1
my	1
experience	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
sung	1
to	1
drown	1
my	1
sorrow	1
but	1
seldom	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
happiness	1
crying	1
for	1
joy	1
and	1
singing	1
for	1
joy	1
were	1
alike	1
uncommon	1
to	1
me	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
slavery	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
cast	1
away	1
upon	1
a	1
desolate	1
island	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
appropriately	1
considered	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
contentment	1
and	1
happiness	1
as	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
a	1
slave	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
are	1
prompted	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
emotion	1
chapter	1
iii	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
kept	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
finely	1
cultivated	1
garden	1
which	1
afforded	1
almost	1
constant	1
employment	1
for	1
four	1
men	1
besides	1
the	1
chief	1
gardener	1
mr	1
m	1
durmond	1
this	1
garden	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
greatest	1
attraction	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
during	1
the	1
summer	1
months	1
people	1
came	1
from	1
far	1
and	1
near	1
from	1
baltimore	1
easton	1
and	1
annapolis	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
it	1
abounded	1
in	1
fruits	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
description	1
from	1
the	1
hardy	1
apple	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
the	1
delicate	1
orange	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
this	1
garden	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
source	1
of	1
trouble	1
on	1
the	1
plantation	1
its	1
excellent	1
fruit	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
temptation	1
to	1
the	1
hungry	1
swarms	1
of	1
boys	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
older	1
slaves	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
few	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
the	1
virtue	1
or	1
the	1
vice	1
to	1
resist	1
it	1
scarcely	1
a	1
day	1
passed	1
during	1
the	1
summer	1
but	1
that	1
some	1
slave	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
lash	1
for	1
stealing	1
fruit	1
the	1
colonel	1
had	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
stratagems	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
slaves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
most	1
successful	1
one	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
tarring	1
his	1
fence	1
all	1
around	1
after	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
slave	1
was	1
caught	1
with	1
any	1
tar	1
upon	1
his	1
person	1
it	1
was	1
deemed	1
sufficient	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
either	1
been	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
or	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
in	1
either	1
case	1
he	1
was	1
severely	1
whipped	1
by	1
the	1
chief	1
gardener	1
this	1
plan	1
worked	1
well	1
the	1
slaves	1
became	1
as	1
fearful	1
of	1
tar	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
lash	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
touching	1
tar	1
without	1
being	1
defiled	1
the	1
colonel	1
also	1
kept	1
a	1
splendid	1
riding	1
equipage	1
his	1
stable	1
and	1
carriage	1
house	1
presented	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
large	1
city	1
livery	1
establishments	1
his	1
horses	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
form	1
and	1
noblest	1
blood	1
his	1
carriage	1
house	1
contained	1
three	1
splendid	1
coaches	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
gigs	1
besides	1
dearborns	1
and	1
barouches	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
fashionable	1
style	1
this	1
establishment	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
two	1
slaves	1
old	1
barney	1
and	1
young	1
barney	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
this	1
establishment	1
was	1
their	1
sole	1
work	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
an	1
easy	1
employment	1
for	1
in	1
nothing	1
was	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
more	1
particular	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
horses	1
the	1
slightest	1
inattention	1
to	1
these	1
was	1
unpardonable	1
and	1
was	1
visited	1
upon	1
those	1
under	1
whose	1
care	1
they	1
were	1
placed	1
with	1
the	1
severest	1
punishment	1
no	1
excuse	1
could	1
shield	1
them	1
if	1
the	1
colonel	1
only	1
suspected	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
horses	1
a	1
supposition	1
which	1
he	1
frequently	1
indulged	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
of	1
course	1
made	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
barney	1
a	1
very	1
trying	1
one	1
they	1
never	1
knew	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
safe	1
from	1
punishment	1
they	1
were	1
frequently	1
whipped	1
when	1
least	1
deserving	1
and	1
escaped	1
whipping	1
when	1
most	1
deserving	1
it	1
every	1
thing	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
looks	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
own	1
mind	1
when	1
his	1
horses	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
use	1
if	1
a	1
horse	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
fast	1
enough	1
or	1
hold	1
his	1
head	1
high	1
enough	1
it	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
some	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
keepers	1
it	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
stand	1
near	1
the	1
stable	1
door	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
various	1
complaints	1
against	1
the	1
keepers	1
when	1
a	1
horse	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
for	1

horse	1

very	1
improperly	1
left	1

to	1
all	1
these	1
complaints	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
unjust	1
the	1
slave	1
must	1
answer	1
never	1
a	1
word	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
could	1
not	1
brook	1
any	1
contradiction	1
from	1
a	1
slave	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
a	1
slave	1
must	1
stand	1
listen	1
and	1
tremble	1
and	1
such	1
was	1
literally	1
the	1
case	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
make	1
old	1
barney	1
a	1
man	1
between	1
fifty	1
and	1
sixty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
uncover	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
kneel	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
cold	1
damp	1
ground	1
and	1
receive	1
upon	1
his	1
naked	1
and	1
toil	1
worn	1
shoulders	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
lashes	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
had	1
three	1
sons	1
edward	1
murray	1
and	1
daniel	1
and	1
three	1
sons	1
in	1
law	1
mr	1
winder	1
mr	1
nicholson	1
and	1
mr	1
lowndes	1
all	1
of	1
these	1
lived	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
farm	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
luxury	1
of	1
whipping	1
the	1
servants	1
when	1
they	1
pleased	1
from	1
old	1
barney	1
down	1
to	1
william	1
wilkes	1
the	1
coach	1
driver	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
winder	1
make	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
servants	1
stand	1
off	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
suitable	1
distance	1
to	1
be	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
stroke	1
raise	1
great	1
ridges	1
upon	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
equal	1
to	1
describing	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
job	1
he	1
kept	1
from	1
ten	1
to	1
fifteen	1
house	1
servants	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
own	1
a	1
thousand	1
slaves	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
this	1
estimate	1
quite	1
within	1
the	1
truth	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
owned	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
nor	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
the	1
out	1
farms	1
know	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
reported	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
while	1
riding	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
met	1
a	1
colored	1
man	1
and	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
manner	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
colored	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
public	1

two	1

afterwards	1
the	1

he	1
was	1

forever	1

from	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
friends	1
by	1
a	1
hand	1
more	1
unrelenting	1
than	1
death	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
telling	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
telling	1
the	1
simple	1
truth	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
plain	1
questions	1
it	1
is	1
partly	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
such	1
facts	1
that	1
slaves	1
when	1
inquired	1
of	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
condition	1
and	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
almost	1
universally	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
contented	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
masters	1
are	1
kind	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
have	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
send	1
in	1
spies	1
among	1
their	1
slaves	1
to	1
ascertain	1
their	1
views	1
and	1
feelings	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
condition	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
this	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
to	1
establish	1
among	1
the	1
slaves	1
the	1
maxim	1
that	1
a	1
still	1
tongue	1
makes	1
a	1
wise	1
head	1
they	1
suppress	1
the	1
truth	1
rather	1
than	1
take	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
telling	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
prove	1
themselves	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
family	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
it	1
is	1
generally	1
in	1
their	1
masters	1
favor	1
especially	1
when	1
speaking	1
to	1
an	1
untried	1
man	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
frequently	1
asked	1
when	1
a	1
slave	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
kind	1
master	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
ever	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
negative	1
answer	1
nor	1
did	1
i	1
in	1
pursuing	1
this	1
course	1
consider	1
myself	1
as	1
uttering	1
what	1
was	1
absolutely	1
false	1
for	1
i	1
always	1
measured	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
by	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
kindness	1
set	1
up	1
among	1
slaveholders	1
around	1
us	1
moreover	1
slaves	1
are	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
and	1
imbibe	1
prejudices	1
quite	1
common	1
to	1
others	1
they	1
think	1
their	1
own	1
better	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
others	1
many	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
this	1
prejudice	1
think	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
other	1
slaves	1
and	1
this	1
too	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
when	1
the	1
very	1
reverse	1
is	1
true	1
indeed	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
uncommon	1
for	1
slaves	1
even	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
and	1
quarrel	1
among	1
themselves	1
about	1
the	1
relative	1
goodness	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
each	1
contending	1
for	1
the	1
superior	1
goodness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
over	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
mutually	1
execrate	1
their	1
masters	1
when	1
viewed	1
separately	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
on	1
our	1
plantation	1
when	1
colonel	1

slaves	1
met	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1

seldom	1
parted	1
without	1
a	1
quarrel	1
about	1
their	1
masters	1

slaves	1
contending	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
richest	1
and	1
mr	1

that	1

was	1

of	1

would	1
almost	1
always	1
end	1
in	1
a	1
fight	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
whipped	1

supposed	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
issue	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
masters	1
was	1
transferable	1
to	1
themselves	1
it	1
was	1
considered	1
as	1
being	1
bad	1

to	1
be	1
a	1

to	1

is	1
better	1
that	1

to	1

just	1
proud	1
enough	1
to	1
demand	1
the	1
most	1
debasing	1
homage	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1

quite	1
servile	1
enough	1
to	1
crouch	1

at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1

commanded	1

dealt	1
sparingly	1
with	1
his	1

bountifully	1
with	1
his	1
whip	1
never	1
using	1
the	1
former	1
where	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
answer	1
as	1

when	1
he	1
whipped	1
he	1

to	1
do	1
so	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1

feared	1

inflexible	1
firmness	1

coolness	1
his	1
savage	1
barbarity	1
was	1
equalled	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
consummate	1
coolness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
committed	1
the	1
grossest	1
and	1
most	1
savage	1
deeds	1
upon	1
the	1
slaves	1
under	1
his	1
charge	1
mr	1
gore	1
once	1
undertook	1
to	1
whip	1
one	1
of	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
slaves	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
demby	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
demby	1
but	1
few	1
stripes	1
when	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
scourging	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
plunged	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
creek	1
and	1
stood	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
shoulders	1
refusing	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
mr	1
gore	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
three	1
calls	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
third	1
call	1
he	1
would	1
shoot	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
call	1
was	1
given	1
demby	1
made	1
no	1
response	1
but	1
stood	1
his	1
ground	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
calls	1
were	1
given	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
result	1
mr	1
gore	1
then	1
without	1
consultation	1
or	1
deliberation	1
with	1
any	1
one	1
not	1
even	1
giving	1
demby	1
an	1
additional	1
call	1
raised	1
his	1
musket	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
taking	1
deadly	1
aim	1
at	1
his	1
standing	1
victim	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
poor	1
demby	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
his	1
mangled	1
body	1
sank	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
blood	1
and	1
brains	1
marked	1
the	1
water	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
horror	1
flashed	1
through	1
every	1
soul	1
upon	1
the	1
plantation	1
excepting	1
mr	1
gore	1
he	1
alone	1
seemed	1
cool	1
and	1
collected	1
he	1
was	1
asked	1
by	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
and	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
why	1
he	1
resorted	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
expedient	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
remember	1
that	1
demby	1
had	1
become	1
unmanageable	1
he	1
was	1
setting	1
a	1
dangerous	1
example	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
slaves	1
one	1
which	1
if	1
suffered	1
to	1
pass	1
without	1
some	1
such	1
demonstration	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
would	1
finally	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
total	1
subversion	1
of	1
all	1
rule	1
and	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
plantation	1
he	1
argued	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
slave	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
corrected	1
and	1
escaped	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
other	1
slaves	1
would	1
soon	1
copy	1
the	1
example	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
slaves	1
and	1
the	1
enslavement	1
of	1
the	1
whites	1
mr	1
gore	1
s	1
defence	1
was	1
satisfactory	1
he	1
was	1
continued	1
in	1
his	1
station	1
as	1
overseer	1
upon	1
the	1
home	1
plantation	1
his	1
fame	1
as	1
an	1
overseer	1
went	1
abroad	1
his	1
horrid	1
crime	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
submitted	1
to	1
judicial	1
investigation	1
it	1
was	1
committed	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
slaves	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
course	1
could	1
neither	1
institute	1
a	1
suit	1
nor	1
testify	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
guilty	1
perpetrator	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bloodiest	1
and	1
most	1
foul	1
murders	1
goes	1

my	1

s	1
cousin	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
between	1
fifteen	1
and	1
sixteen	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
mangling	1
her	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
manner	1
breaking	1
her	1
nose	1
and	1
breastbone	1
with	1
a	1
stick	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
expired	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
afterward	1
she	1
was	1
immediately	1
buried	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
untimely	1
grave	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
and	1
examined	1
by	1
the	1
coroner	1
who	1
decided	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
death	1
by	1
severe	1
beating	1
the	1
offence	1
for	1
which	1
this	1
girl	1
was	1
thus	1
murdered	1
was	1
this	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
that	1
night	1
to	1
mind	1
mrs	1
hicks	1
s	1
baby	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
fell	1
asleep	1
and	1
the	1
baby	1
cried	1
she	1
having	1
lost	1
her	1
rest	1
for	1
several	1
nights	1
previous	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
crying	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
mrs	1
hicks	1
mrs	1
hicks	1
finding	1
the	1
girl	1
slow	1
to	1
move	1
jumped	1
from	1
her	1
bed	1
seized	1
an	1
oak	1
stick	1
of	1
wood	1
by	1
the	1
fireplace	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
broke	1
the	1
girl	1
s	1
nose	1
and	1
breastbone	1
and	1
thus	1
ended	1
her	1
life	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
most	1
horrid	1
murder	1
produced	1
no	1
sensation	1
in	1
the	1
community	1
it	1
did	1
produce	1
sensation	1
but	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
murderess	1
to	1
punishment	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
warrant	1
issued	1
for	1
her	1
arrest	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
served	1
thus	1
she	1
escaped	1
not	1
only	1
punishment	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
being	1
arraigned	1
before	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
her	1
horrid	1
crime	1
whilst	1
i	1
am	1
detailing	1
bloody	1
deeds	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
during	1
my	1
stay	1
on	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
i	1
will	1
briefly	1
narrate	1
another	1
which	1
occurred	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
demby	1
by	1
mr	1
gore	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
slaves	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
nights	1
and	1
sundays	1
in	1
fishing	1
for	1
oysters	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
their	1
scanty	1
allowance	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
belonging	1
to	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
while	1
thus	1
engaged	1
happened	1
to	1
get	1
beyond	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
premises	1
of	1
mr	1
beal	1
bondly	1
at	1
this	1
trespass	1
mr	1
bondly	1
took	1
offence	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
musket	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
blew	1
its	1
deadly	1
contents	1
into	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man	1
mr	1
bondly	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
see	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
whether	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
property	1
or	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
this	1
whole	1
fiendish	1
transaction	1
was	1
soon	1
hushed	1
up	1
there	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
said	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
nothing	1
done	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
common	1
saying	1
even	1
among	1
little	1
white	1
boys	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
a	1
half	1
cent	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
nigger	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
cent	1
to	1
bury	1
one	1
chapter	1
v	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
treatment	1
while	1
i	1
lived	1
on	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
slave	1
children	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
there	1
being	1
little	1
else	1
than	1
field	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
leisure	1
time	1
the	1
most	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
up	1
the	1
cows	1
at	1
evening	1
keep	1
the	1
fowls	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
keep	1
the	1
front	1
yard	1
clean	1
and	1
run	1
of	1
errands	1
for	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
s	1
daughter	1
mrs	1
lucretia	1
auld	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
leisure	1
time	1
i	1
spent	1
in	1
helping	1
master	1
daniel	1
lloyd	1
in	1
finding	1
his	1
birds	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
shot	1
them	1
my	1
connection	1
with	1
master	1
daniel	1
was	1
of	1
some	1
advantage	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
became	1
quite	1
attached	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
protector	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
older	1
boys	1
to	1
impose	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
would	1
divide	1
his	1
cakes	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
seldom	1
whipped	1
by	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
and	1
suffered	1
little	1
from	1
any	1
thing	1
else	1
than	1
hunger	1
and	1
cold	1
i	1
suffered	1
much	1
from	1
hunger	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
from	1
cold	1
in	1
hottest	1
summer	1
and	1
coldest	1
winter	1
i	1
was	1
kept	1
almost	1
naked	1
no	1
shoes	1
no	1
stockings	1
no	1
jacket	1
no	1
trousers	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
a	1
coarse	1
tow	1
linen	1
shirt	1
reaching	1
only	1
to	1
my	1
knees	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
bed	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
perished	1
with	1
cold	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
coldest	1
nights	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
steal	1
a	1
bag	1
which	1
was	1
used	1
for	1
carrying	1
corn	1
to	1
the	1
mill	1
i	1
would	1
crawl	1
into	1
this	1
bag	1
and	1
there	1
sleep	1
on	1
the	1
cold	1
damp	1
clay	1
floor	1
with	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
and	1
feet	1
out	1
my	1
feet	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
cracked	1
with	1
the	1
frost	1
that	1
the	1
pen	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
writing	1
might	1
be	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
gashes	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
regularly	1
allowanced	1
our	1
food	1
was	1
coarse	1
corn	1
meal	1
boiled	1
this	1
was	1
called	1
mush	1
it	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
wooden	1
tray	1
or	1
trough	1
and	1
set	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
then	1
called	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
pigs	1
and	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
pigs	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
devour	1
the	1
mush	1
some	1
with	1
oyster	1
shells	1
others	1
with	1
pieces	1
of	1
shingle	1
some	1
with	1
naked	1
hands	1
and	1
none	1
with	1
spoons	1
he	1
that	1
ate	1
fastest	1
got	1
most	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
strongest	1
secured	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
and	1
few	1
left	1
the	1
trough	1
satisfied	1
i	1
was	1
probably	1
between	1
seven	1
and	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
i	1
left	1
it	1
with	1
joy	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
ecstasy	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
received	1
the	1
intelligence	1
that	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
anthony	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
baltimore	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
mr	1
hugh	1
auld	1
brother	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
s	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
captain	1
thomas	1
auld	1
i	1
received	1
this	1
information	1
about	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
my	1
departure	1
they	1
were	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
days	1
i	1
ever	1
enjoyed	1
i	1
spent	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
creek	1
washing	1
off	1
the	1
plantation	1
scurf	1
and	1
preparing	1
myself	1
for	1
my	1
departure	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
appearance	1
which	1
this	1
would	1
indicate	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
own	1
i	1
spent	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
washing	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
but	1
because	1
mrs	1
lucretia	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
get	1
all	1
the	1
dead	1
skin	1
off	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
knees	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
go	1
to	1
baltimore	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
baltimore	1
were	1
very	1
cleanly	1
and	1
would	1
laugh	1
at	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
looked	1
dirty	1
besides	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
trousers	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
put	1
on	1
unless	1
i	1
got	1
all	1
the	1
dirt	1
off	1
me	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
owning	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
trousers	1
was	1
great	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
sufficient	1
motive	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
take	1
off	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
pig	1
drovers	1
the	1
mange	1
but	1
the	1
skin	1
itself	1
i	1
went	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
good	1
earnest	1
working	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
reward	1
the	1
ties	1
that	1
ordinarily	1
bind	1
children	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
were	1
all	1
suspended	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
i	1
found	1
no	1
severe	1
trial	1
in	1
my	1
departure	1
my	1
home	1
was	1
charmless	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
home	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
parting	1
from	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
any	1
thing	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
staying	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
dead	1
my	1
grandmother	1
lived	1
far	1
off	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
seldom	1
saw	1
her	1
i	1
had	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
one	1
brother	1
that	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
the	1
early	1
separation	1
of	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
mother	1
had	1
well	1
nigh	1
blotted	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
our	1
relationship	1
from	1
our	1
memories	1
i	1
looked	1
for	1
home	1
elsewhere	1
and	1
was	1
confident	1
of	1
finding	1
none	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
relish	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
if	1
however	1
i	1
found	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
home	1
hardship	1
hunger	1
whipping	1
and	1
nakedness	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
consolation	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
escaped	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
staying	1
having	1
already	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
and	1
having	1
endured	1
them	1
there	1
i	1
very	1
naturally	1
inferred	1
my	1
ability	1
to	1
endure	1
them	1
elsewhere	1
and	1
especially	1
at	1
baltimore	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
about	1
baltimore	1
that	1
is	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
being	1
hanged	1
in	1
england	1
is	1
preferable	1
to	1
dying	1
a	1
natural	1
death	1
in	1
ireland	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
strongest	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
baltimore	1
cousin	1
tom	1
though	1
not	1
fluent	1
in	1
speech	1
had	1
inspired	1
me	1
with	1
that	1
desire	1
by	1
his	1
eloquent	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
i	1
could	1
never	1
point	1
out	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
beautiful	1
or	1
powerful	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
something	1
at	1
baltimore	1
far	1
exceeding	1
both	1
in	1
beauty	1
and	1
strength	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
i	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
even	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
itself	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
pictures	1
was	1
far	1
inferior	1
to	1
many	1
buildings	1
in	1
baltimore	1
so	1
strong	1
was	1
my	1
desire	1
that	1
i	1
thought	1
a	1
gratification	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
fully	1
compensate	1
for	1
whatever	1
loss	1
of	1
comforts	1
i	1
should	1
sustain	1
by	1
the	1
exchange	1
i	1
left	1
without	1
a	1
regret	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
hopes	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
we	1
sailed	1
out	1
of	1
miles	1
river	1
for	1
baltimore	1
on	1
a	1
saturday	1
morning	1
i	1
remember	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
nor	1
the	1
months	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
on	1
setting	1
sail	1
i	1
walked	1
aft	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
what	1
i	1
hoped	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
look	1
i	1
then	1
placed	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
sloop	1
and	1
there	1
spent	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
looking	1
ahead	1
interesting	1
myself	1
in	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
things	1
near	1
by	1
or	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
we	1
reached	1
annapolis	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
we	1
stopped	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
shore	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
large	1
town	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
look	1
small	1
compared	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
new	1
england	1
factory	1
villages	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
wonderful	1
place	1
for	1
its	1
size	1
more	1
imposing	1
even	1
than	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
farm	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
baltimore	1
early	1
on	1
sunday	1
morning	1
landing	1
at	1
smith	1
s	1
wharf	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
bowley	1
s	1
wharf	1
we	1
had	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
sloop	1
a	1
large	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
and	1
after	1
aiding	1
in	1
driving	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
slaughterhouse	1
of	1
mr	1
curtis	1
on	1
louden	1
slater	1
s	1
hill	1
i	1
was	1
conducted	1
by	1
rich	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
belonging	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
sloop	1
to	1
my	1
new	1
home	1
in	1
alliciana	1
street	1
near	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
on	1
fells	1
point	1
mr	1
and	1
mrs	1
auld	1
were	1
both	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
met	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
son	1
thomas	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
and	1
here	1
i	1
saw	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
beaming	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
kindly	1
emotions	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
mistress	1
sophia	1
auld	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
describe	1
the	1
rapture	1
that	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
soul	1
as	1
i	1
beheld	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
strange	1
sight	1
to	1
me	1
brightening	1
up	1
my	1
pathway	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
happiness	1
little	1
thomas	1
was	1
told	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
freddy	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
little	1
thomas	1
and	1
thus	1
i	1
entered	1
upon	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
cheering	1
prospect	1
ahead	1
i	1
look	1
upon	1
my	1
departure	1
from	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
events	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
and	1
even	1
quite	1
probable	1
that	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
circumstance	1
of	1
being	1
removed	1
from	1
that	1
plantation	1
to	1
baltimore	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
day	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
here	1
seated	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1

the	1
foundation	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
gateway	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
subsequent	1
prosperity	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
regarded	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
plain	1
manifestation	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
providence	1
which	1
has	1
ever	1
since	1
attended	1
me	1
and	1
marked	1
my	1
life	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
favors	1
i	1
regarded	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
myself	1
as	1
being	1
somewhat	1
remarkable	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
slave	1
children	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
from	1
the	1
plantation	1
to	1
baltimore	1
there	1
were	1
those	1
younger	1
those	1
older	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
i	1
was	1
chosen	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
last	1
and	1
only	1
choice	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
superstitious	1
and	1
even	1
egotistical	1
in	1
regarding	1
this	1
event	1
as	1
a	1
special	1
interposition	1
of	1
divine	1
providence	1
in	1
my	1
favor	1
but	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
the	1
earliest	1
sentiments	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
if	1
i	1
suppressed	1
the	1
opinion	1
i	1
prefer	1
to	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
myself	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
hazard	1
of	1
incurring	1
the	1
ridicule	1
of	1
others	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
false	1
and	1
incur	1
my	1
own	1
abhorrence	1
from	1
my	1
earliest	1
recollection	1
i	1
date	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
a	1
deep	1
conviction	1
that	1
slavery	1
would	1
not	1
always	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
me	1
within	1
its	1
foul	1
embrace	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
darkest	1
hours	1
of	1
my	1
career	1
in	1
slavery	1
this	1
living	1
word	1
of	1
faith	1

not	1
from	1
me	1

remained	1

me	1

my	1
new	1
mistress	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
she	1
appeared	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
met	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
kindest	1
heart	1
and	1
finest	1
feelings	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
slave	1
under	1
her	1
control	1
previously	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
prior	1
to	1
her	1
marriage	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
dependent	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
industry	1
for	1
a	1
living	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
trade	1
a	1
weaver	1
and	1
by	1
constant	1
application	1
to	1
her	1
business	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
degree	1
preserved	1
from	1
the	1
blighting	1
and	1
dehumanizing	1
effects	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
was	1
utterly	1
astonished	1
at	1
her	1
goodness	1
i	1
scarcely	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
towards	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
entirely	1
unlike	1
any	1
other	1
white	1
woman	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
approach	1
her	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
approach	1
other	1
white	1
ladies	1
my	1
early	1
instruction	1
was	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
the	1
crouching	1
servility	1
usually	1
so	1
acceptable	1
a	1
quality	1
in	1
a	1
slave	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
when	1
manifested	1
toward	1
her	1
her	1
favor	1
was	1
not	1
gained	1
by	1
it	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
disturbed	1
by	1
it	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
deem	1
it	1
impudent	1
or	1
unmannerly	1
for	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
look	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
the	1
meanest	1
slave	1
was	1
put	1
fully	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
and	1
none	1
left	1
without	1
feeling	1
better	1
for	1
having	1
seen	1
her	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
heavenly	1
smiles	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
of	1
tranquil	1
music	1
but	1
alas	1
this	1
kind	1
heart	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
to	1
remain	1
such	1
the	1
fatal	1
poison	1
of	1
irresponsible	1
power	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
soon	1
commenced	1
its	1
infernal	1
work	1
that	1
cheerful	1
eye	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
slavery	1
soon	1
became	1
red	1
with	1
rage	1
that	1
voice	1
made	1
all	1
of	1
sweet	1
accord	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
harsh	1
and	1
horrid	1
discord	1
and	1
that	1
angelic	1
face	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
demon	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
mr	1
and	1
mrs	1
auld	1
she	1
very	1
kindly	1
commenced	1
to	1
teach	1
me	1
the	1
a	1
b	1
c	1
after	1
i	1
had	1
learned	1
this	1
she	1
assisted	1
me	1
in	1
learning	1
to	1
spell	1
words	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
letters	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
my	1
progress	1
mr	1
auld	1
found	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
forbade	1
mrs	1
auld	1
to	1
instruct	1
me	1
further	1
telling	1
her	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
unlawful	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unsafe	1
to	1
teach	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
read	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
further	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
a	1
nigger	1
an	1
inch	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
an	1
ell	1
a	1
nigger	1
should	1
know	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
told	1
to	1
do	1
learning	1
would	1
_spoil_	1
the	1
best	1
nigger	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
now	1
said	1
he	1
if	1
you	1
teach	1
that	1
nigger	1
speaking	1
of	1
myself	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
keeping	1
him	1
it	1
would	1
forever	1
unfit	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
slave	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
become	1
unmanageable	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
value	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
as	1
to	1
himself	1
it	1
could	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
good	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
harm	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
discontented	1
and	1
unhappy	1
these	1
words	1
sank	1
deep	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
stirred	1
up	1
sentiments	1
within	1
that	1
lay	1
slumbering	1
and	1
called	1
into	1
existence	1
an	1
entirely	1
new	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
special	1
revelation	1
explaining	1
dark	1
and	1
mysterious	1
things	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
youthful	1
understanding	1
had	1
struggled	1
but	1
struggled	1
in	1
vain	1
i	1
now	1
understood	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
most	1
perplexing	1
difficulty	1
to	1
wit	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
power	1
to	1
enslave	1
the	1
black	1
man	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
achievement	1
and	1
i	1
prized	1
it	1
highly	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
understood	1
the	1
pathway	1
from	1
slavery	1
to	1
freedom	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
and	1
i	1
got	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
i	1
the	1
least	1
expected	1
it	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
saddened	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
losing	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
my	1
kind	1
mistress	1
i	1
was	1
gladdened	1
by	1
the	1
invaluable	1
instruction	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
merest	1
accident	1
i	1
had	1
gained	1
from	1
my	1
master	1
though	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
learning	1
without	1
a	1
teacher	1
i	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
high	1
hope	1
and	1
a	1
fixed	1
purpose	1
at	1
whatever	1
cost	1
of	1
trouble	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
very	1
decided	1
manner	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
spoke	1
and	1
strove	1
to	1
impress	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
the	1
evil	1
consequences	1
of	1
giving	1
me	1
instruction	1
served	1
to	1
convince	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
deeply	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
truths	1
he	1
was	1
uttering	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
best	1
assurance	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
rely	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
confidence	1
on	1
the	1
results	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
would	1
flow	1
from	1
teaching	1
me	1
to	1
read	1
what	1
he	1
most	1
dreaded	1
that	1
i	1
most	1
desired	1
what	1
he	1
most	1
loved	1
that	1
i	1
most	1
hated	1
that	1
which	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
evil	1
to	1
be	1
carefully	1
shunned	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
diligently	1
sought	1
and	1
the	1
argument	1
which	1
he	1
so	1
warmly	1
urged	1
against	1
my	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
only	1
served	1
to	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
desire	1
and	1
determination	1
to	1
learn	1
in	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
i	1
owe	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
bitter	1
opposition	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
kindly	1
aid	1
of	1
my	1
mistress	1
i	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
both	1
i	1
had	1
resided	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
baltimore	1
before	1
i	1
observed	1
a	1
marked	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
treatment	1
of	1
slaves	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
witnessed	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
a	1
city	1
slave	1
is	1
almost	1
a	1
freeman	1
compared	1
with	1
a	1
slave	1
on	1
the	1
plantation	1
he	1
is	1
much	1
better	1
fed	1
and	1
clothed	1
and	1
enjoys	1
privileges	1
altogether	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
slave	1
on	1
the	1
plantation	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
vestige	1
of	1
decency	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
that	1
does	1
much	1
to	1
curb	1
and	1
check	1
those	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
atrocious	1
cruelty	1
so	1
commonly	1
enacted	1
upon	1
the	1
plantation	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
desperate	1
slaveholder	1
who	1
will	1
shock	1
the	1
humanity	1
of	1
his	1
non	1
slaveholding	1
neighbors	1
with	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
his	1
lacerated	1
slave	1
few	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
incur	1
the	1
odium	1
attaching	1
to	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
cruel	1
master	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
as	1
not	1
giving	1
a	1
slave	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
every	1
city	1
slaveholder	1
is	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
known	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
feeds	1
his	1
slaves	1
well	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
do	1
give	1
their	1

henrietta	1
was	1
about	1
twenty	1
two	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
mary	1
was	1
about	1
fourteen	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mangled	1
and	1
emaciated	1
creatures	1
i	1
ever	1
looked	1
upon	1
these	1
two	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
so	1
his	1
heart	1
must	1
be	1
harder	1
than	1
stone	1
that	1
could	1
look	1
upon	1
these	1
unmoved	1
the	1
head	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
of	1
mary	1
were	1
literally	1
cut	1
to	1
pieces	1
i	1
have	1
frequently	1
felt	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
nearly	1
covered	1
with	1
festering	1
sores	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
lash	1
of	1
her	1
cruel	1
mistress	1
i	1
do	1
not	1

that	1
her	1

ever	1

in	1

nearly	1
every	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
cowskin	1
always	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
scarce	1
an	1
hour	1
passed	1

was	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1

seldom	1
passed	1
her	1

_black	1

with	1
the	1

over	1
the	1

mary	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
pigs	1
for	1
the	1

much	1
was	1

about	1
seven	1
years	1
during	1
this	1

i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
in	1
accomplishing	1
this	1
i	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
various	1
stratagems	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
regular	1
teacher	1
my	1
mistress	1
who	1
had	1
kindly	1
commenced	1
to	1

me	1

in	1
compliance	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
direction	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
not	1
only	1
ceased	1
to	1
instruct	1
but	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
face	1
against	1
my	1
being	1
instructed	1
by	1
any	1
one	1
else	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
however	1
to	1
my	1
mistress	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
adopt	1
this	1
course	1
of	1
treatment	1
immediately	1
she	1
at	1
first	1
lacked	1
the	1
depravity	1
indispensable	1
to	1
shutting	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
mental	1
darkness	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
necessary	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
training	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
irresponsible	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
treating	1
me	1
as	1
though	1
i	1
were	1
a	1
brute	1
my	1
mistress	1
was	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
kind	1
and	1
tender	1
hearted	1
woman	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
her	1
soul	1
she	1
commenced	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
treat	1
me	1
as	1
she	1
supposed	1
one	1
human	1
being	1
ought	1
to	1
treat	1
another	1
in	1
entering	1
upon	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
i	1
sustained	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
chattel	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
treat	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
wrong	1
but	1
dangerously	1
so	1
slavery	1
proved	1
as	1
injurious	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
pious	1
warm	1
and	1
tender	1
hearted	1
woman	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sorrow	1
or	1
suffering	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
tear	1
she	1
had	1
bread	1
for	1
the	1
hungry	1
clothes	1
for	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
comfort	1
for	1
every	1
mourner	1
that	1
came	1
within	1
her	1
reach	1
slavery	1
soon	1
proved	1
its	1
ability	1
to	1
divest	1
her	1
of	1
these	1
heavenly	1
qualities	1
under	1
its	1
influence	1
the	1
tender	1
heart	1
became	1
stone	1
and	1
the	1
lamblike	1
disposition	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
tiger	1
like	1
fierceness	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
in	1
her	1
downward	1
course	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
ceasing	1
to	1
instruct	1
me	1
she	1
now	1
commenced	1
to	1
practise	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
precepts	1
she	1
finally	1
became	1
even	1
more	1
violent	1
in	1
her	1
opposition	1
than	1
her	1
husband	1
himself	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
satisfied	1
with	1
simply	1
doing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
she	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
nothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
more	1
angry	1
than	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
newspaper	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
here	1
lay	1
the	1
danger	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
her	1
rush	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
made	1
all	1
up	1
of	1
fury	1
and	1
snatch	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
newspaper	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
fully	1
revealed	1
her	1
apprehension	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
apt	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
experience	1
soon	1
demonstrated	1
to	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
education	1
and	1
slavery	1
were	1
incompatible	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
most	1
narrowly	1
watched	1
if	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
separate	1
room	1
any	1
considerable	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
suspected	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
called	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
myself	1
all	1
this	1
however	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
mistress	1
in	1
teaching	1
me	1
the	1
alphabet	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
_inch	1
_	1
and	1
no	1
precaution	1
could	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
taking	1
the	1
_ell	1
_	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
i	1
adopted	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
most	1
successful	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
making	1
friends	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
white	1
boys	1
whom	1
i	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
converted	1
into	1
teachers	1
with	1
their	1
kindly	1
aid	1
obtained	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
different	1
places	1
i	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
sent	1
of	1
errands	1
i	1
always	1
took	1
my	1
book	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
by	1
going	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
errand	1
quickly	1
i	1
found	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
lesson	1
before	1
my	1
return	1
i	1
used	1
also	1
to	1
carry	1
bread	1
with	1
me	1
enough	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
always	1
welcome	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
off	1
in	1
this	1
regard	1
than	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
white	1
children	1
in	1
our	1
neighborhood	1
this	1
bread	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
the	1
hungry	1
little	1
urchins	1
who	1
in	1
return	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
more	1
valuable	1
bread	1
of	1
knowledge	1
i	1
am	1
strongly	1
tempted	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
those	1
little	1
boys	1
as	1
a	1
testimonial	1
of	1
the	1
gratitude	1
and	1
affection	1
i	1
bear	1
them	1
but	1
prudence	1
forbids	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
injure	1
me	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
embarrass	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
an	1
unpardonable	1
offence	1
to	1
teach	1
slaves	1
to	1
read	1
in	1
this	1
christian	1
country	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
dear	1
little	1
fellows	1
that	1
they	1
lived	1
on	1
philpot	1
street	1
very	1
near	1
durgin	1
and	1
bailey	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
talk	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
slavery	1
over	1
with	1
them	1
i	1
would	1
sometimes	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
i	1
wished	1
i	1
could	1
be	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
twenty	1
one	1
_but	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
slave	1
for	1
life	1
_	1
have	1
not	1
i	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
these	1
words	1
used	1
to	1
trouble	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
express	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
liveliest	1
sympathy	1
and	1
console	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
occur	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
free	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
_a	1
slave	1
for	1
life_	1
began	1
to	1
bear	1
heavily	1
upon	1
my	1
heart	1
just	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
entitled	1
the	1
columbian	1
orator	1
every	1
opportunity	1
i	1
got	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
this	1
book	1
among	1
much	1
of	1
other	1
interesting	1
matter	1
i	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
dialogue	1
between	1
a	1
master	1
and	1
his	1
slave	1
the	1
slave	1
was	1
represented	1
as	1
having	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
three	1
times	1
the	1
dialogue	1
represented	1
the	1
conversation	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
slave	1
was	1
retaken	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
dialogue	1
the	1
whole	1
argument	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
slavery	1
was	1
brought	1
forward	1
by	1
the	1
master	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
disposed	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
slave	1
the	1
slave	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
say	1
some	1
very	1
smart	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
impressive	1
things	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
desired	1
though	1
unexpected	1
effect	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
resulted	1
in	1
the	1
voluntary	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
book	1
i	1
met	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
sheridan	1
s	1
mighty	1
speeches	1
on	1
and	1
in	1
behalf	1
of	1
catholic	1
emancipation	1
these	1
were	1
choice	1
documents	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
read	1
them	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
with	1
unabated	1
interest	1
they	1
gave	1
tongue	1
to	1
interesting	1
thoughts	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
soul	1
which	1
had	1
frequently	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
died	1
away	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
utterance	1
the	1
moral	1
which	1
i	1
gained	1
from	1
the	1
dialogue	1
was	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
truth	1
over	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
even	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
what	1
i	1
got	1
from	1
sheridan	1
was	1
a	1
bold	1
denunciation	1
of	1
slavery	1
and	1
a	1
powerful	1
vindication	1
of	1
human	1
rights	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
these	1
documents	1
enabled	1
me	1
to	1
utter	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
arguments	1
brought	1
forward	1
to	1
sustain	1
slavery	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
relieved	1
me	1
of	1
one	1
difficulty	1
they	1
brought	1
on	1
another	1
even	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
relieved	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
read	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
abhor	1
and	1
detest	1
my	1
enslavers	1
i	1
could	1
regard	1
them	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
light	1
than	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
successful	1
robbers	1
who	1
had	1
left	1
their	1
homes	1
and	1
gone	1
to	1
africa	1
and	1
stolen	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
homes	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1
reduced	1
us	1
to	1
slavery	1
i	1
loathed	1
them	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
meanest	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
wicked	1
of	1
men	1
as	1
i	1
read	1
and	1
contemplated	1
the	1
subject	1
behold	1
that	1
very	1
discontentment	1
which	1
master	1
hugh	1
had	1
predicted	1
would	1
follow	1
my	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
had	1
already	1
come	1
to	1
torment	1
and	1
sting	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
unutterable	1
anguish	1
as	1
i	1
writhed	1
under	1
it	1
i	1
would	1
at	1
times	1
feel	1
that	1
learning	1
to	1
read	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
curse	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
blessing	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
my	1
wretched	1
condition	1
without	1
the	1
remedy	1
it	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
horrible	1
pit	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
ladder	1
upon	1
which	1

out	1
in	1
moments	1
of	1
agony	1
i	1
envied	1
my	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
for	1
their	1
stupidity	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
wished	1
myself	1
a	1
beast	1
i	1
preferred	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
meanest	1
reptile	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
any	1

no	1

this	1
everlasting	1

tormented	1
me	1
there	1

no	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1

every	1

or	1

inanimate	1
the	1
silver	1
trump	1
of	1
freedom	1
had	1
roused	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
eternal	1
wakefulness	1
freedom	1
now	1
appeared	1
to	1
disappear	1
no	1
more	1
forever	1
it	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
every	1
sound	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
it	1
was	1
ever	1
present	1
to	1
torment	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
my	1
wretched	1

i	1
saw	1
nothing	1

nothing	1
without	1

from	1

in	1
every	1
calm	1
breathed	1
in	1
every	1
wind	1
and	1
moved	1
in	1
every	1
storm	1
i	1
often	1
found	1
myself	1
regretting	1
my	1
own	1
existence	1
and	1
wishing	1
myself	1
dead	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
free	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
killed	1
myself	1
or	1
done	1
something	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
while	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
i	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
hear	1
any	1
one	1
speak	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
ready	1
listener	1
every	1
little	1
while	1
i	1
could	1
hear	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
abolitionists	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
i	1
found	1
what	1
the	1
word	1
meant	1
it	1
was	1
always	1
used	1
in	1
such	1
connections	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
an	1
interesting	1
word	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
a	1
slave	1
ran	1
away	1
and	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
clear	1
or	1
if	1
a	1
slave	1
killed	1
his	1
master	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
a	1
barn	1
or	1
did	1
any	1
thing	1
very	1
wrong	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
it	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
_abolition	1
_	1
hearing	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
this	1
connection	1
very	1
often	1
i	1
set	1
about	1
learning	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
the	1
dictionary	1
afforded	1
me	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
help	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
abolishing	1
but	1
then	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
abolished	1
here	1
i	1
was	1
perplexed	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
one	1
about	1
its	1
meaning	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
satisfied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
something	1
they	1
wanted	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
after	1
a	1
patient	1
waiting	1
i	1
got	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
city	1
papers	1
containing	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
petitions	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
praying	1
for	1
the	1
abolition	1
of	1
slavery	1
in	1
the	1
district	1
of	1
columbia	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
slave	1
trade	1
between	1
the	1
states	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
understood	1
the	1
words	1
_abolition_	1
and	1
_abolitionist	1
_	1
and	1
always	1
drew	1
near	1
when	1
that	1
word	1
was	1
spoken	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
the	1
light	1
broke	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
by	1
degrees	1
i	1
went	1
one	1
day	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
wharf	1
of	1
mr	1
waters	1
and	1
seeing	1
two	1
irishmen	1
unloading	1
a	1
scow	1
of	1
stone	1
i	1
went	1
unasked	1
and	1
helped	1
them	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
a	1
slave	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
he	1
asked	1
are	1
ye	1
a	1
slave	1
for	1
life	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
irishman	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
deeply	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
statement	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
pity	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
little	1
fellow	1
as	1
myself	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
slave	1
for	1
life	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
shame	1
to	1
hold	1
me	1
they	1
both	1
advised	1
me	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
find	1
friends	1
there	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
free	1
i	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
and	1
treated	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
them	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
treacherous	1
white	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
encourage	1
slaves	1
to	1
escape	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
reward	1
catch	1
them	1
and	1
return	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
masters	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
these	1
seemingly	1
good	1
men	1
might	1
use	1
me	1
so	1
but	1
i	1
nevertheless	1
remembered	1
their	1
advice	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
i	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
a	1
time	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safe	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
escape	1
i	1
was	1
too	1
young	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
immediately	1
besides	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
as	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
occasion	1
to	1
write	1
my	1
own	1
pass	1
i	1
consoled	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
one	1
day	1
find	1
a	1
good	1
chance	1
meanwhile	1
i	1
would	1
learn	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
idea	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
i	1
might	1
learn	1
to	1
write	1
was	1
suggested	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
being	1
in	1
durgin	1
and	1
bailey	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
and	1
frequently	1
seeing	1
the	1
ship	1
carpenters	1
after	1
hewing	1
and	1
getting	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
timber	1
ready	1
for	1
use	1
write	1
on	1
the	1
timber	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
intended	1
when	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
timber	1
was	1
intended	1
for	1
the	1
larboard	1
side	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
marked	1
thus	1
l	1
when	1
a	1
piece	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
starboard	1
side	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
marked	1
thus	1
s	1

piece	1
for	1

for	1

aft	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
marked	1
thus	1
s	1
a	1
i	1
soon	1
learned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
these	1
letters	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
intended	1
when	1
placed	1
upon	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
timber	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
yard	1
i	1
immediately	1
commenced	1
copying	1
them	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
four	1
letters	1
named	1
after	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
met	1
with	1
any	1
boy	1
who	1
i	1
knew	1
could	1
write	1
i	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
i	1
could	1
write	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
the	1
next	1
word	1
would	1
be	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
believe	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
you	1
try	1
it	1
i	1
would	1
then	1
make	1
the	1
letters	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
beat	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
lessons	1
in	1
writing	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
possible	1
i	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
gotten	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
copy	1
book	1
was	1
the	1
board	1
fence	1
brick	1
wall	1
and	1
pavement	1
my	1
pen	1
and	1
ink	1
was	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
chalk	1
with	1
these	1
i	1
learned	1
mainly	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
i	1
then	1
commenced	1
and	1
continued	1
copying	1
the	1
italics	1
in	1
webster	1
s	1
spelling	1
book	1
until	1
i	1
could	1
make	1
them	1
all	1
without	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
book	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
my	1
little	1
master	1
thomas	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
school	1
and	1
learned	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
and	1
had	1
written	1
over	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
copy	1
books	1
these	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
home	1
and	1
shown	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
near	1
neighbors	1
and	1
then	1
laid	1
aside	1
my	1
mistress	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
class	1
meeting	1
at	1
the	1
wilk	1
street	1
meetinghouse	1
every	1
monday	1
afternoon	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
left	1
thus	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
writing	1
in	1
the	1
spaces	1
left	1
in	1
master	1
thomas	1
s	1
copy	1
book	1
copying	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
i	1
continued	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
until	1
i	1
could	1
write	1
a	1
hand	1
very	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
master	1
thomas	1
thus	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
tedious	1
effort	1
for	1
years	1
i	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
learning	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
chapter	1
viii	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
baltimore	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
s	1
youngest	1
son	1
richard	1
died	1
and	1
in	1
about	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
captain	1
anthony	1
died	1
leaving	1
only	1
his	1
son	1
andrew	1
and	1
daughter	1
lucretia	1
to	1
share	1
his	1
estate	1
he	1
died	1
while	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
daughter	1
at	1
hillsborough	1
cut	1
off	1
thus	1
unexpectedly	1
he	1
left	1
no	1
will	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
it	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
valuation	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
equally	1
divided	1
between	1
mrs	1
lucretia	1
and	1
master	1
andrew	1
i	1
was	1
immediately	1
sent	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
valued	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
property	1
here	1
again	1
my	1
feelings	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
detestation	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
a	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
my	1
degraded	1
condition	1
prior	1
to	1
this	1
i	1
had	1
become	1
if	1
not	1
insensible	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
at	1
least	1
partly	1
so	1
i	1
left	1
baltimore	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
heart	1
overborne	1
with	1
sadness	1
and	1
a	1
soul	1
full	1
of	1
apprehension	1
i	1
took	1
passage	1
with	1
captain	1
rowe	1
in	1
the	1
schooner	1
wild	1
cat	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
sail	1
of	1
about	1
twenty	1
four	1
hours	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
near	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
birth	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
absent	1
from	1
it	1
almost	1
if	1
not	1
quite	1
five	1
years	1
i	1
however	1
remembered	1
the	1
place	1
very	1
well	1
i	1
was	1
only	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
on	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
between	1
ten	1
and	1
eleven	1
years	1
old	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
ranked	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
valuation	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
old	1
and	1
young	1
married	1
and	1
single	1
were	1
ranked	1
with	1
horses	1
sheep	1
and	1
swine	1
there	1
were	1
horses	1
and	1
men	1
cattle	1
and	1
women	1
pigs	1
and	1
children	1
all	1
holding	1
the	1
same	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
being	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
narrow	1
examination	1
silvery	1
headed	1
age	1
and	1
sprightly	1
youth	1
maids	1
and	1
matrons	1
had	1
to	1
undergo	1
the	1
same	1
indelicate	1
inspection	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
i	1
saw	1
more	1
clearly	1
than	1
ever	1
the	1
brutalizing	1
effects	1
of	1
slavery	1
upon	1
both	1
slave	1
and	1
slaveholder	1
after	1
the	1
valuation	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
division	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
language	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
high	1
excitement	1
and	1
deep	1
anxiety	1
which	1
were	1
felt	1
among	1
us	1
poor	1
slaves	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
our	1
fate	1
for	1
life	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
we	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
voice	1
in	1
that	1
decision	1
than	1
the	1
brutes	1
among	1
whom	1
we	1
were	1
ranked	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
white	1
men	1
was	1
enough	1
against	1
all	1
our	1
wishes	1
prayers	1
and	1
entreaties	1
to	1
sunder	1
forever	1
the	1
dearest	1
friends	1
dearest	1
kindred	1
and	1
strongest	1
ties	1
known	1
to	1
human	1
beings	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
horrid	1
dread	1
of	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
master	1
andrew	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
most	1
cruel	1
wretch	1

had	1
by	1
his	1
reckless	1
mismanagement	1
and	1
profligate	1
dissipation	1
already	1
wasted	1
a	1
large	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
property	1
we	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
sold	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
georgia	1
traders	1
as	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
for	1
we	1
knew	1
that	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
our	1
inevitable	1
condition	1
a	1
condition	1
held	1
by	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
horror	1
and	1
dread	1
i	1
suffered	1
more	1
anxiety	1
than	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
i	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
kindly	1
treated	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
little	1
or	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
deed	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
acquainted	1
with	1
grief	1
their	1
backs	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
familiar	1
with	1
the	1
bloody	1
lash	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
callous	1
mine	1
was	1
yet	1
tender	1
for	1
while	1
at	1
baltimore	1
i	1
got	1
few	1
whippings	1
and	1
few	1
slaves	1
could	1
boast	1
of	1
a	1
kinder	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
than	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
passing	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
master	1
andrew	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
sample	1
of	1
his	1
bloody	1
disposition	1
took	1
my	1
little	1
brother	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
threw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
heel	1
of	1
his	1
boot	1
stamped	1
upon	1
his	1
head	1
till	1
the	1
blood	1
gushed	1
from	1
his	1
nose	1
and	1
ears	1
was	1
well	1
calculated	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
anxious	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
fate	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
this	1
savage	1
outrage	1
upon	1
my	1
brother	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
serve	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
meaning	1
i	1
suppose	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
possession	1
thanks	1
to	1
a	1
kind	1
providence	1
i	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
mrs	1
lucretia	1
and	1
was	1
sent	1
immediately	1
back	1
to	1
baltimore	1
to	1
live	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
master	1
hugh	1
their	1
joy	1
at	1
my	1
return	1
equalled	1
their	1
sorrow	1
at	1
my	1
departure	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
glad	1
day	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
escaped	1
a	1
worse	1
than	1
lion	1
s	1
jaws	1
i	1
was	1
absent	1
from	1
baltimore	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
valuation	1
and	1
division	1
just	1
about	1
one	1
month	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
six	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
baltimore	1
my	1
mistress	1
lucretia	1
died	1
leaving	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
one	1
child	1
amanda	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
after	1
her	1
death	1
master	1
andrew	1
died	1
now	1
all	1
the	1

of	1
my	1

was	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
strangers	1
strangers	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
accumulating	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
slave	1
was	1
left	1
free	1
all	1
remained	1
slaves	1
from	1
the	1
youngest	1
to	1
the	1
oldest	1
if	1
any	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
experience	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
served	1
to	1
deepen	1
my	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
infernal	1
character	1
of	1
slavery	1
and	1
to	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
unutterable	1
loathing	1
of	1
slaveholders	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
base	1
ingratitude	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
old	1
grandmother	1
she	1
had	1
served	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
faithfully	1
from	1
youth	1
to	1
old	1
age	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wealth	1
she	1
had	1
peopled	1
his	1
plantation	1
with	1
slaves	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
grandmother	1
in	1
his	1
service	1
she	1
had	1
rocked	1
him	1
in	1
infancy	1
attended	1
him	1
in	1
childhood	1
served	1
him	1
through	1
life	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
death	1
wiped	1
from	1
his	1
icy	1
brow	1
the	1
cold	1
death	1
sweat	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
forever	1
she	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
left	1
a	1
slave	1
a	1
slave	1
for	1
life	1
a	1
slave	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
strangers	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
children	1
her	1
grandchildren	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
grandchildren	1
divided	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
sheep	1
without	1
being	1
gratified	1
with	1
the	1
small	1
privilege	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
or	1
her	1
own	1
destiny	1
and	1
to	1
cap	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
their	1
base	1
ingratitude	1
and	1
fiendish	1
barbarity	1
my	1
grandmother	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
old	1
having	1
outlived	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
children	1

seen	1
the	1
beginning	1

end	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
her	1
present	1
owners	1
finding	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
but	1
little	1
value	1
her	1
frame	1
already	1
racked	1
with	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
complete	1
helplessness	1
fast	1
stealing	1
over	1
her	1
once	1
active	1
limbs	1
they	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
built	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
hut	1
put	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
mud	1
chimney	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
her	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
supporting	1
herself	1
there	1
in	1
perfect	1
loneliness	1
thus	1
virtually	1
turning	1
her	1
out	1
to	1
die	1
if	1
my	1
poor	1

now	1
lives	1
she	1

lived	1
in	1
st	1
michael	1

not	1
long	1
after	1
his	1
marriage	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
master	1
hugh	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
punishing	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
himself	1
at	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
here	1
i	1
underwent	1
another	1
most	1
painful	1
separation	1
it	1
however	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
severe	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
i	1
dreaded	1
at	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
property	1
for	1
during	1
this	1
interval	1
a	1
great	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
master	1
hugh	1
and	1
his	1
once	1
kind	1
and	1
affectionate	1
wife	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
brandy	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
slavery	1
upon	1
her	1
had	1
effected	1
a	1
disastrous	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
both	1
so	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
concerned	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
had	1
little	1
to	1
lose	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
attached	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
those	1
little	1
baltimore	1
boys	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
strongest	1
attachment	1
i	1
had	1
received	1
many	1
good	1
lessons	1
from	1
them	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
receiving	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
leaving	1
them	1
was	1
painful	1
indeed	1
i	1
was	1
leaving	1
too	1
without	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
ever	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
return	1
master	1
thomas	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
let	1
me	1
return	1
again	1
the	1
barrier	1
betwixt	1
himself	1
and	1
brother	1
he	1
considered	1
impassable	1
i	1
then	1
had	1
to	1
regret	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
least	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
my	1
resolution	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
for	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
success	1
are	1
tenfold	1
greater	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
sailed	1
from	1
baltimore	1
for	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
sloop	1
amanda	1
captain	1
edward	1
dodson	1
on	1
my	1
passage	1
i	1
paid	1
particular	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
direction	1
which	1
the	1
steamboats	1
took	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
philadelphia	1
i	1
found	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
down	1
on	1
reaching	1
north	1
point	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
bay	1
in	1
a	1
north	1
easterly	1
direction	1
i	1
deemed	1
this	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance	1
my	1
determination	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
was	1
again	1
revived	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
wait	1
only	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
a	1
favorable	1
opportunity	1
when	1
that	1
came	1
i	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
chapter	1
ix	1
i	1
have	1
now	1
reached	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
when	1
i	1
can	1
give	1
dates	1
i	1
left	1
baltimore	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
master	1
thomas	1
auld	1
at	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
in	1
march	1
1832	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
seven	1
years	1
since	1
i	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
on	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
we	1
of	1
course	1
were	1
now	1
almost	1
entire	1
strangers	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
new	1
master	1
and	1
i	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
slave	1
i	1
was	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
temper	1
and	1
disposition	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
so	1
of	1
mine	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
however	1
brought	1
us	1
into	1
full	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
i	1
was	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
with	1
himself	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
matched	1
being	1
equally	1
mean	1
and	1
cruel	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
seven	1
years	1
made	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
painful	1
gnawings	1
of	1
hunger	1
a	1
something	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
experienced	1
before	1
since	1
i	1
left	1
colonel	1
lloyd	1
s	1
plantation	1
it	1
went	1
hard	1
enough	1
with	1
me	1
then	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
look	1
back	1
to	1
no	1
period	1
at	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
sufficiency	1
it	1
was	1
tenfold	1
harder	1
after	1
living	1
in	1
master	1
hugh	1
s	1
family	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
master	1
thomas	1
was	1
a	1
mean	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
slave	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
is	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
aggravated	1
development	1
of	1
meanness	1
even	1
among	1
slaveholders	1
the	1
rule	1
is	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
coarse	1
the	1
food	1
only	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
enough	1
of	1
it	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
theory	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
maryland	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
came	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
general	1
practice	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
exceptions	1
master	1
thomas	1
gave	1
us	1
enough	1
of	1
neither	1
coarse	1
nor	1
fine	1
food	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
slaves	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
my	1
sister	1
eliza	1
my	1
aunt	1
priscilla	1
henny	1
and	1
myself	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
allowed	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
bushel	1
of	1
corn	1
meal	1
per	1
week	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
else	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
meat	1
or	1
vegetables	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
subsist	1
upon	1
we	1
were	1
therefore	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
wretched	1
necessity	1
of	1
living	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
our	1
neighbors	1
this	1
we	1
did	1
by	1
begging	1
and	1
stealing	1
whichever	1
came	1
handy	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
need	1
the	1
one	1
being	1
considered	1
as	1
legitimate	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
times	1
have	1
we	1
poor	1
creatures	1
been	1
nearly	1
perishing	1
with	1
hunger	1
when	1
food	1
in	1
abundance	1
lay	1
mouldering	1
in	1
the	1
safe	1
and	1
smoke	1
house	1
and	1
our	1
pious	1
mistress	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
mistress	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
kneel	1
every	1
morning	1
and	1
pray	1
that	1
god	1
would	1
bless	1
them	1
in	1
basket	1
and	1
store	1
bad	1
as	1
all	1
slaveholders	1
are	1
we	1
seldom	1
meet	1
one	1
destitute	1
of	1
every	1
element	1
of	1
character	1
commanding	1
respect	1
my	1
master	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
rare	1
sort	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
one	1
single	1
noble	1
act	1
ever	1
performed	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
leading	1
trait	1
in	1
his	1
character	1
was	1
meanness	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
other	1
element	1
in	1
his	1
nature	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
subject	1
to	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
mean	1
and	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
mean	1
men	1
he	1
lacked	1
the	1
ability	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
meanness	1
captain	1
auld	1
was	1
not	1
born	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
master	1
only	1
of	1
a	1
bay	1
craft	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
slaves	1
by	1
marriage	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
adopted	1
slaveholders	1
are	1
the	1
worst	1
he	1
was	1
cruel	1
but	1
cowardly	1
he	1
commanded	1
without	1
firmness	1
in	1
the	1
enforcement	1
of	1
his	1
rules	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
times	1
rigid	1
and	1
at	1
times	1
lax	1
at	1
times	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
his	1
slaves	1
with	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
napoleon	1
and	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
a	1
demon	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
an	1
inquirer	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
way	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
passed	1
for	1
a	1
lion	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
ears	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
noble	1
which	1
he	1
attempted	1
his	1
own	1
meanness	1
shone	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
his	1
airs	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
were	1
the	1
airs	1
words	1
and	1
actions	1
of	1
born	1
slaveholders	1
and	1
being	1
assumed	1
were	1
awkward	1
enough	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
good	1
imitator	1
he	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
disposition	1
to	1
deceive	1
but	1
wanted	1
the	1
power	1
having	1
no	1
resources	1
within	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
copyist	1
of	1
many	1
and	1
being	1
such	1
he	1
was	1
forever	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
inconsistency	1
and	1
of	1
consequence	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
contempt	1
and	1
was	1
held	1
as	1
such	1
even	1
by	1
his	1
slaves	1
the	1
luxury	1
of	1
having	1
slaves	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
unprepared	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
without	1
the	1
ability	1
to	1
hold	1
slaves	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
incapable	1
of	1
managing	1
his	1
slaves	1
either	1
by	1
force	1
fear	1
or	1
fraud	1
we	1
seldom	1
called	1
him	1
master	1
we	1
generally	1
called	1
him	1
captain	1
auld	1
and	1
were	1
hardly	1
disposed	1
to	1
title	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
our	1
conduct	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
making	1
him	1
appear	1
awkward	1
and	1
of	1
consequence	1
fretful	1
our	1
want	1
of	1
reverence	1
for	1
him	1
must	1
have	1
perplexed	1
him	1
greatly	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
us	1
call	1
him	1
master	1
but	1
lacked	1
the	1
firmness	1
necessary	1
to	1
command	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
his	1
wife	1
used	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
our	1
calling	1
him	1
so	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
in	1
august	1
1832	1
my	1
master	1
attended	1
a	1
methodist	1
camp	1
meeting	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
bay	1
side	1
talbot	1
county	1
and	1
there	1
experienced	1
religion	1
i	1
indulged	1
a	1
faint	1
hope	1
that	1
his	1
conversion	1
would	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
emancipate	1
his	1
slaves	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
it	1
would	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
make	1
him	1
more	1
kind	1
and	1
humane	1
i	1
was	1
disappointed	1
in	1
both	1
these	1
respects	1
it	1
neither	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
humane	1
to	1
his	1
slaves	1
nor	1
to	1
emancipate	1
them	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
any	1
effect	1
on	1
his	1
character	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
more	1
cruel	1
and	1
hateful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways	1
for	1
i	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
much	1
worse	1
man	1
after	1
his	1
conversion	1
than	1
before	1
prior	1
to	1
his	1
conversion	1
he	1
relied	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
depravity	1
to	1
shield	1
and	1
sustain	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
savage	1
barbarity	1
but	1
after	1
his	1
conversion	1
he	1
found	1
religious	1
sanction	1
and	1
support	1
for	1
his	1
slaveholding	1
cruelty	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
greatest	1
pretensions	1
to	1
piety	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer	1
he	1
prayed	1
morning	1
noon	1
and	1
night	1
he	1
very	1
soon	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
among	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
a	1
class	1
leader	1
and	1
exhorter	1
his	1
activity	1
in	1
revivals	1
was	1
great	1
and	1
he	1
proved	1
himself	1
an	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
converting	1
many	1
souls	1
his	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
preachers	1
home	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
coming	1
there	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
for	1
while	1
he	1
starved	1
us	1
he	1
stuffed	1
them	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
preachers	1
there	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
most	1
frequently	1
while	1
i	1
lived	1
there	1
were	1
mr	1
storks	1
mr	1
ewery	1
mr	1
humphry	1
and	1
mr	1
hickey	1
i	1
have	1
also	1
seen	1
mr	1
george	1
cookman	1
at	1
our	1
house	1
we	1
slaves	1
loved	1
mr	1
cookman	1
we	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
we	1
thought	1
him	1
instrumental	1
in	1
getting	1
mr	1
samuel	1
harrison	1
a	1
very	1
rich	1
slaveholder	1
to	1
emancipate	1
his	1
slaves	1
and	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
got	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
laboring	1
to	1
effect	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
slaves	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
our	1
house	1
we	1
were	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
to	1
prayers	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
there	1
we	1
were	1
sometimes	1
called	1
in	1
and	1
sometimes	1
not	1
mr	1
cookman	1
took	1
more	1
notice	1
of	1
us	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
ministers	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
among	1
us	1
without	1
betraying	1
his	1
sympathy	1
for	1
us	1
and	1
stupid	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
sagacity	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
while	1
i	1
lived	1
with	1
my	1
master	1
in	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
young	1
man	1
a	1
mr	1
wilson	1
who	1
proposed	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
sabbath	1
school	1
for	1
the	1
instruction	1
of	1
such	1
slaves	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
we	1
met	1
but	1
three	1
times	1
when	1
mr	1
west	1
and	1
mr	1
fairbanks	1
both	1
class	1
leaders	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
came	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
sticks	1
and	1
other	1
missiles	1
drove	1
us	1
off	1
and	1
forbade	1
us	1
to	1
meet	1
again	1
thus	1
ended	1
our	1
little	1
sabbath	1
school	1
in	1
the	1
pious	1
town	1
of	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
my	1
master	1
found	1
religious	1
sanction	1
for	1
his	1
cruelty	1
as	1
an	1
example	1
i	1
will	1
state	1
one	1
of	1
many	1
facts	1
going	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
charge	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
tie	1
up	1
a	1
lame	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
whip	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
cowskin	1
upon	1
her	1
naked	1
shoulders	1
causing	1
the	1
warm	1
red	1
blood	1
to	1
drip	1
and	1
in	1
justification	1
of	1
the	1
bloody	1
deed	1
he	1
would	1
quote	1
this	1
passage	1
of	1
scripture	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
will	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
many	1
stripes	1
master	1
would	1
keep	1
this	1
lacerated	1
young	1
woman	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
horrid	1
situation	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
hours	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
tie	1
her	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
whip	1
her	1
before	1
breakfast	1
leave	1
her	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
store	1
return	1
at	1
dinner	1
and	1
whip	1
her	1
again	1
cutting	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
already	1
made	1
raw	1
with	1
his	1
cruel	1
lash	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
master	1
s	1
cruelty	1
toward	1
henny	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
almost	1
helpless	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
child	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
burned	1
herself	1
horribly	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
so	1
burnt	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
got	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
very	1
little	1
but	1
bear	1
heavy	1
burdens	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
master	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
expense	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
mean	1
man	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
offence	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
getting	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
out	1
of	1
existence	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
away	1
once	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
but	1
being	1
a	1
poor	1
gift	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
finally	1
my	1
benevolent	1
master	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
set	1
her	1
adrift	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
herself	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
recently	1
converted	1
man	1
holding	1
on	1
upon	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
turning	1
out	1
her	1
helpless	1
child	1
to	1
starve	1
and	1
die	1
master	1
thomas	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
pious	1
slaveholders	1
who	1
hold	1
slaves	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
charitable	1
purpose	1
of	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
them	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
myself	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
differences	1
he	1
found	1
me	1
unsuitable	1
to	1
his	1
purpose	1
my	1
city	1
life	1
he	1
said	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
pernicious	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
it	1
had	1
almost	1
ruined	1
me	1
for	1
every	1
good	1
purpose	1
and	1
fitted	1
me	1
for	1
every	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
bad	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
greatest	1
faults	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
letting	1
his	1
horse	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
inlaw	1
s	1
farm	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
miles	1
from	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
i	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
after	1
it	1
my	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
carelessness	1
or	1
carefulness	1
was	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
always	1
get	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
master	1
william	1
hamilton	1
my	1
master	1
s	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
always	1
gave	1
his	1
slaves	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
i	1
never	1
left	1
there	1
hungry	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
great	1
the	1
need	1
of	1
my	1
speedy	1
return	1
master	1
thomas	1
at	1
length	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
stand	1
it	1
no	1
longer	1
i	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
nine	1
months	1
during	1
which	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
severe	1
whippings	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
good	1
purpose	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
he	1
let	1
me	1
for	1
one	1
year	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
named	1

mr	1
covey	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
reputation	1
for	1
breaking	1
young	1
slaves	1
and	1
this	1
reputation	1
was	1
of	1
immense	1
value	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
farm	1
tilled	1
with	1
much	1
less	1
expense	1
to	1
himself	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
it	1
done	1
without	1
such	1
a	1
reputation	1
some	1
slaveholders	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
much	1
loss	1
to	1
allow	1
mr	1
covey	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
slaves	1
one	1
year	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
training	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
subjected	1
without	1
any	1
other	1
compensation	1
he	1
could	1
hire	1
young	1
help	1
with	1
great	1
ease	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
reputation	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
good	1
qualities	1
of	1
mr	1
covey	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
religion	1
a	1
pious	1
soul	1
a	1
member	1
and	1
a	1
class	1
leader	1
in	1
the	1
methodist	1
church	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
added	1
weight	1
to	1
his	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
nigger	1
breaker	1
i	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
there	1
i	1
nevertheless	1
made	1
the	1
change	1
gladly	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
getting	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
consideration	1
to	1
a	1
hungry	1

i	1
had	1
left	1
master	1
thomas	1

house	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
on	1
the	1
1st	1
of	1
january	1
1833	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
a	1
field	1
hand	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
employment	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
even	1
more	1
awkward	1
than	1
a	1
country	1
boy	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
city	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
my	1
new	1
home	1
but	1
one	1
week	1
before	1
mr	1
covey	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
severe	1
whipping	1
cutting	1
my	1
back	1
causing	1
the	1
blood	1
to	1
run	1
and	1
raising	1
ridges	1
on	1
my	1
flesh	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
my	1
little	1
finger	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
this	1
affair	1
are	1
as	1
follows	1
mr	1
covey	1
sent	1
me	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
coldest	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
january	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wood	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
team	1
of	1
unbroken	1
oxen	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
in	1
hand	1
ox	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
off	1
hand	1
one	1
he	1
then	1
tied	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
rope	1
around	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
in	1
hand	1
ox	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
oxen	1
started	1
to	1
run	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
hold	1
on	1
upon	1
the	1
rope	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
driven	1
oxen	1
before	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
awkward	1
i	1
however	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
with	1
little	1
difficulty	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
rods	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
when	1
the	1
oxen	1
took	1
fright	1
and	1
started	1
full	1
tilt	1
carrying	1
the	1
cart	1
against	1
trees	1
and	1
over	1
stumps	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
frightful	1
manner	1
i	1
expected	1
every	1
moment	1
that	1
my	1
brains	1
would	1
be	1
dashed	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
trees	1
after	1
running	1
thus	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
they	1
finally	1
upset	1
the	1
cart	1
dashing	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
force	1
against	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
threw	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
dense	1
thicket	1
how	1
i	1
escaped	1
death	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
there	1
i	1
was	1
entirely	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
wood	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
new	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
cart	1
was	1
upset	1
and	1
shattered	1
my	1
oxen	1
were	1
entangled	1
among	1
the	1
young	1
trees	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
spell	1
of	1
effort	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
my	1
cart	1
righted	1
my	1
oxen	1
disentangled	1
and	1
again	1
yoked	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
i	1
now	1
proceeded	1
with	1
my	1
team	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
been	1
chopping	1
wood	1
and	1
loaded	1
my	1
cart	1
pretty	1
heavily	1
thinking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
tame	1
my	1
oxen	1
i	1
then	1
proceeded	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
home	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
consumed	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
safely	1
and	1
now	1
felt	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
i	1
stopped	1
my	1
oxen	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
woods	1
gate	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
ox	1
rope	1
the	1
oxen	1
again	1
started	1
rushed	1
through	1
the	1
gate	1
catching	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
wheel	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
tearing	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
and	1
coming	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
crushing	1
me	1
against	1
the	1
gate	1
post	1
thus	1
twice	1
in	1
one	1
short	1
day	1
i	1
escaped	1
death	1
by	1
the	1
merest	1
chance	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
i	1
told	1
mr	1
covey	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
happened	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
again	1
immediately	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
and	1
he	1
followed	1
on	1
after	1
me	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
stop	1
my	1
cart	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
teach	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
trifle	1
away	1
my	1
time	1
and	1
break	1
gates	1
he	1
then	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
gum	1
tree	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
axe	1
cut	1
three	1
large	1
switches	1
and	1
after	1
trimming	1
them	1
up	1
neatly	1
with	1
his	1
pocketknife	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
my	1
clothes	1
i	1
made	1
him	1
no	1
answer	1
but	1
stood	1
with	1
my	1
clothes	1
on	1
he	1
repeated	1
his	1
order	1
i	1
still	1
made	1
him	1
no	1
answer	1
nor	1
did	1
i	1
move	1
to	1
strip	1
myself	1
upon	1
this	1
he	1
rushed	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
a	1
tiger	1
tore	1
off	1
my	1
clothes	1
and	1
lashed	1
me	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
worn	1
out	1
his	1
switches	1
cutting	1
me	1
so	1
savagely	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
marks	1
visible	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
after	1
this	1
whipping	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
just	1
like	1
it	1
and	1
for	1
similar	1
offences	1
i	1
lived	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
one	1
year	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
six	1
months	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
scarce	1
a	1
week	1
passed	1
without	1
his	1
whipping	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
seldom	1
free	1
from	1
a	1
sore	1
back	1
my	1
awkwardness	1
was	1
almost	1
always	1
his	1
excuse	1
for	1
whipping	1
me	1
we	1
were	1
worked	1
fully	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
endurance	1
long	1
before	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
up	1
our	1
horses	1
fed	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
approach	1
of	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
with	1
our	1
hoes	1
and	1
ploughing	1
teams	1
mr	1
covey	1
gave	1
us	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
scarce	1
time	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
we	1
were	1
often	1
less	1
than	1
five	1
minutes	1
taking	1
our	1
meals	1
we	1
were	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
approach	1
of	1
day	1
till	1
its	1
last	1
lingering	1
ray	1
had	1
left	1
us	1
and	1
at	1
saving	1
fodder	1
time	1
midnight	1
often	1
caught	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
binding	1
blades	1
covey	1
would	1
be	1
out	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
stand	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
afternoons	1
in	1
bed	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
come	1
out	1
fresh	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
ready	1
to	1
urge	1
us	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
words	1
example	1
and	1
frequently	1
with	1
the	1
whip	1
mr	1
covey	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
slaveholders	1
who	1
could	1
and	1
did	1
work	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
hard	1
working	1
man	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
himself	1
just	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
boy	1
could	1
do	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
deceiving	1
him	1
his	1
work	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
absence	1
almost	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
making	1
us	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
ever	1
present	1
with	1
us	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
by	1
surprising	1
us	1
he	1
seldom	1
approached	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
openly	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
it	1
secretly	1
he	1
always	1
aimed	1
at	1
taking	1
us	1
by	1
surprise	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
cunning	1
that	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
among	1
ourselves	1
the	1
snake	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
cornfield	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
crawl	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
to	1
avoid	1
detection	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
would	1
rise	1
nearly	1
in	1
our	1
midst	1
and	1
scream	1
out	1
ha	1
ha	1
come	1
come	1
dash	1
on	1
dash	1
on	1
this	1
being	1
his	1
mode	1
of	1
attack	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
safe	1
to	1
stop	1
a	1
single	1
minute	1
his	1
comings	1
were	1
like	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
being	1
ever	1
at	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
every	1
tree	1
behind	1
every	1
stump	1
in	1
every	1
bush	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
window	1
on	1
the	1
plantation	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
mount	1
his	1
horse	1
as	1
if	1
bound	1
to	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
seven	1
miles	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
afterwards	1
you	1
would	1
see	1
him	1
coiled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
fence	1
watching	1
every	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
slaves	1
he	1
would	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
leave	1
his	1
horse	1
tied	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
again	1
he	1
would	1
sometimes	1
walk	1
up	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
orders	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
turn	1
his	1
back	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
make	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
half	1
way	1
thither	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
short	1
and	1
crawl	1
into	1
a	1
fence	1
corner	1
or	1
behind	1
some	1
tree	1
and	1
there	1
watch	1
us	1
till	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
mr	1
covey	1
s	1
forte	1
consisted	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
deceive	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
devoted	1
to	1
planning	1
and	1
perpetrating	1
the	1
grossest	1
deceptions	1
every	1
thing	1
he	1
possessed	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
learning	1
or	1
religion	1
he	1
made	1
conform	1
to	1
his	1
disposition	1
to	1
deceive	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
think	1
himself	1
equal	1
to	1
deceiving	1
the	1
almighty	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
short	1
prayer	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
prayer	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem	1
few	1
men	1
would	1
at	1
times	1
appear	1
more	1
devotional	1
than	1
he	1
the	1
exercises	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
devotions	1
were	1
always	1
commenced	1
with	1
singing	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
singer	1
himself	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
raising	1
the	1
hymn	1
generally	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
he	1
would	1
read	1
his	1
hymn	1
and	1
nod	1
at	1
me	1
to	1
commence	1
i	1
would	1
at	1
times	1
do	1
so	1
at	1
others	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
my	1
non	1
compliance	1
would	1
almost	1
always	1
produce	1
much	1
confusion	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
independent	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
would	1
start	1
and	1
stagger	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
hymn	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
discordant	1
manner	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
he	1
prayed	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
ordinary	1
spirit	1
poor	1
man	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
disposition	1
and	1
success	1
at	1
deceiving	1
i	1
do	1
verily	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
sometimes	1
deceived	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
solemn	1
belief	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sincere	1
worshipper	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
god	1
and	1
this	1
too	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
compelling	1
his	1
woman	1
slave	1
to	1
commit	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
adultery	1
the	1
facts	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
are	1
these	1
mr	1
covey	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
commencing	1
in	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
able	1
to	1
buy	1
one	1
slave	1
and	1
shocking	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
he	1
bought	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
a	1
breeder	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
named	1
caroline	1
mr	1
covey	1
bought	1
her	1
from	1
mr	1
thomas	1
lowe	1
about	1
six	1
miles	1
from	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
able	1
bodied	1
woman	1
about	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
one	1
child	1
which	1
proved	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
after	1
buying	1
her	1
he	1
hired	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
of	1
mr	1
samuel	1
harrison	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
one	1
year	1
and	1
him	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
fasten	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
every	1
night	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
the	1
miserable	1
woman	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
twins	1
at	1
this	1
result	1
mr	1
covey	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
highly	1
pleased	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
wretched	1
woman	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
joy	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
nothing	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
caroline	1
during	1
her	1
confinement	1
was	1
too	1
good	1
or	1
too	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
regarded	1
as	1
being	1
quite	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
wealth	1
if	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
i	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
bitterest	1
dregs	1
of	1
slavery	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
six	1
months	1
of	1
my	1
stay	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
we	1
were	1
worked	1
in	1
all	1
weathers	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
too	1
hot	1
or	1
too	1
cold	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
rain	1
blow	1
hail	1
or	1
snow	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
work	1
work	1
work	1
was	1
scarcely	1
more	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
longest	1
days	1
were	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
shortest	1
nights	1
too	1
long	1
for	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
somewhat	1
unmanageable	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
went	1
there	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
of	1
this	1
discipline	1
tamed	1
me	1
mr	1
covey	1
succeeded	1
in	1
breaking	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
broken	1
in	1
body	1
soul	1
and	1
spirit	1
my	1
natural	1
elasticity	1
was	1
crushed	1
my	1
intellect	1
languished	1
the	1
disposition	1
to	1
read	1
departed	1
the	1
cheerful	1
spark	1
that	1
lingered	1
about	1
my	1
eye	1
died	1
the	1
dark	1
night	1
of	1
slavery	1
closed	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
brute	1
sunday	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
leisure	1
time	1
i	1
spent	1
this	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
beast	1
like	1
stupor	1
between	1
sleep	1
and	1
wake	1
under	1
some	1
large	1
tree	1
at	1
times	1
i	1
would	1
rise	1
up	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
energetic	1
freedom	1
would	1
dart	1
through	1
my	1
soul	1
accompanied	1
with	1
a	1
faint	1
beam	1
of	1
hope	1
that	1
flickered	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
vanished	1
i	1
sank	1
down	1
again	1
mourning	1
over	1
my	1
wretched	1
condition	1
i	1
was	1
sometimes	1
prompted	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
covey	1
but	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
fear	1
my	1
sufferings	1
on	1
this	1
plantation	1
seem	1
now	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
stern	1
reality	1
our	1
house	1
stood	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
rods	1
of	1
the	1
chesapeake	1
bay	1

broad	1
bosom	1
was	1
ever	1
white	1
with	1
sails	1
from	1
every	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
habitable	1
globe	1
those	1
beautiful	1
vessels	1
robed	1
in	1
purest	1
white	1
so	1
delightful	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
freemen	1
were	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
many	1
shrouded	1
ghosts	1
to	1
terrify	1
and	1
torment	1
me	1
with	1
thoughts	1
of	1
my	1
wretched	1
condition	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
stillness	1
of	1
a	1
summer	1

sabbath	1
stood	1
all	1
alone	1
upon	1
the	1
lofty	1
banks	1
of	1
that	1
noble	1
bay	1

traced	1
with	1
saddened	1
heart	1

tearful	1
eye	1
the	1
countless	1
number	1
of	1
sails	1
moving	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
mighty	1
ocean	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
always	1
affected	1
me	1
powerfully	1
my	1
thoughts	1
would	1
compel	1
utterance	1
and	1
there	1
with	1
no	1
audience	1
but	1
the	1
almighty	1
i	1
would	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
soul	1

myself	1
to	1
my	1

was	1
much	1
worse	1
during	1

months	1
of	1
my	1

an	1
epoch	1
in	1
my	1
humble	1
history	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
slave	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
a	1
slave	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hottest	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
august	1
1833	1
bill	1
smith	1
william	1
hughes	1
a	1
slave	1
named	1
eli	1
and	1
myself	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
fanning	1
wheat	1
hughes	1
was	1
clearing	1
the	1
fanned	1
wheat	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
fan	1
eli	1
was	1
turning	1
smith	1
was	1
feeding	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
carrying	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
fan	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
simple	1
requiring	1
strength	1
rather	1
than	1
intellect	1
yet	1
to	1
one	1
entirely	1
unused	1
to	1
such	1
work	1
it	1
came	1
very	1
hard	1
about	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
i	1
broke	1
down	1
my	1
strength	1
failed	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
aching	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
attended	1
with	1
extreme	1
dizziness	1
i	1
trembled	1
in	1
every	1
limb	1
finding	1
what	1
was	1
coming	1
i	1
nerved	1
myself	1
up	1
feeling	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
stop	1
work	1
i	1
stood	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
stagger	1
to	1
the	1
hopper	1
with	1
grain	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
stand	1
no	1
longer	1
i	1
fell	1
and	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
held	1
down	1
by	1
an	1
immense	1
weight	1
the	1
fan	1
of	1
course	1
stopped	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
go	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
mr	1
covey	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
one	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
treading	1
yard	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
fanning	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
fan	1
stop	1
he	1
left	1
immediately	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
he	1
hastily	1
inquired	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
bill	1
answered	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
sick	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
bring	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
fan	1
i	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
crawled	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
and	1
rail	1
fence	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
yard	1
was	1
enclosed	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
relief	1
by	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
he	1
then	1
asked	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
awhile	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
for	1
i	1
scarce	1
had	1
strength	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
then	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
savage	1
kick	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
but	1
fell	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
attempt	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
another	1
kick	1
and	1
again	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
rise	1
i	1
again	1
tried	1
and	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
my	1
feet	1
but	1
stooping	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
tub	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
feeding	1
the	1
fan	1
i	1
again	1
staggered	1
and	1
fell	1
while	1
down	1
in	1
this	1
situation	1
mr	1
covey	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
hickory	1
slat	1
with	1
which	1
hughes	1
had	1
been	1
striking	1
off	1
the	1
half	1
bushel	1
measure	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
heavy	1
blow	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
making	1
a	1
large	1
wound	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
ran	1
freely	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
again	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
i	1
made	1
no	1
effort	1
to	1
comply	1
having	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
his	1
worst	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
after	1
receiving	1
this	1
blow	1
my	1
head	1
grew	1
better	1
mr	1
covey	1
had	1
now	1
left	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
fate	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
i	1
resolved	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
enter	1
a	1
complaint	1
and	1
ask	1
his	1
protection	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
i	1
must	1
that	1
afternoon	1
walk	1
seven	1
miles	1
and	1
this	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
was	1
truly	1
a	1
severe	1
undertaking	1
i	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
feeble	1
made	1
so	1
as	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
kicks	1
and	1
blows	1
which	1
i	1
received	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
severe	1
fit	1
of	1
sickness	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
subjected	1
i	1
however	1
watched	1
my	1
chance	1
while	1
covey	1
was	1
looking	1
in	1
an	1
opposite	1
direction	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
when	1
covey	1
discovered	1
me	1
and	1
called	1
after	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
threatening	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
i	1
disregarded	1
both	1
his	1
calls	1
and	1
his	1
threats	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
woods	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
my	1
feeble	1
state	1
would	1
allow	1
and	1
thinking	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
overhauled	1
by	1
him	1
if	1
i	1
kept	1
the	1
road	1
i	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
keeping	1
far	1
enough	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
avoid	1
detection	1
and	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
prevent	1
losing	1
my	1
way	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
before	1
my	1
little	1
strength	1
again	1
failed	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
go	1
no	1
farther	1
i	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
lay	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
yet	1
oozing	1
from	1
the	1
wound	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
should	1
bleed	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
think	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
so	1
matted	1
my	1
hair	1
as	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
wound	1
after	1
lying	1
there	1
about	1
three	1
quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
i	1
nerved	1
myself	1
up	1
again	1
and	1
started	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
through	1
bogs	1
and	1
briers	1
barefooted	1
and	1
bareheaded	1
tearing	1
my	1
feet	1
sometimes	1
at	1
nearly	1
every	1
step	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
about	1
seven	1
miles	1
occupying	1
some	1
five	1
hours	1
to	1
perform	1
it	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
master	1
s	1
store	1
i	1
then	1
presented	1
an	1
appearance	1
enough	1
to	1
affect	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
iron	1
from	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
my	1
feet	1
i	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
blood	1
my	1
hair	1
was	1
all	1
clotted	1
with	1
dust	1
and	1
blood	1
my	1
shirt	1
was	1
stiff	1
with	1
blood	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
escaped	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
wild	1
beasts	1
and	1
barely	1
escaped	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
i	1
appeared	1
before	1
my	1
master	1
humbly	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
interpose	1
his	1
authority	1
for	1
my	1
protection	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
i	1
spoke	1
at	1
times	1
to	1
affect	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
walk	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
seek	1
to	1
justify	1
covey	1
by	1
saying	1
he	1
expected	1
i	1
deserved	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
a	1
new	1
home	1
that	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
i	1
lived	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
again	1
i	1
should	1
live	1
with	1
but	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
covey	1
would	1
surely	1
kill	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fair	1
way	1
for	1
it	1
master	1
thomas	1
ridiculed	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
mr	1
covey	1
s	1
killing	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
mr	1
covey	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
taking	1
me	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
should	1
he	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
lose	1
the	1
whole	1
year	1
s	1
wages	1
that	1
i	1
belonged	1
to	1
mr	1
covey	1
for	1
one	1
year	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
come	1
what	1
might	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
trouble	1
him	1
with	1
any	1
more	1
stories	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
himself	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
after	1
threatening	1
me	1
thus	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
dose	1
of	1
salts	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
that	1
night	1
it	1
being	1
quite	1
late	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
off	1
back	1
to	1
mr	1
covey	1
s	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
would	1
_get	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
_	1
which	1
meant	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
whip	1
me	1
i	1
remained	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
orders	1
i	1
started	1
off	1
to	1
covey	1
s	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
saturday	1
morning	1
wearied	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
broken	1
in	1
spirit	1
i	1
got	1
no	1
supper	1
that	1
night	1
or	1
breakfast	1
that	1
morning	1
i	1
reached	1
covey	1
s	1
about	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
getting	1
over	1
the	1
fence	1
that	1
divided	1
mrs	1
kemp	1
s	1
fields	1
from	1
ours	1
out	1
ran	1
covey	1
with	1
his	1
cowskin	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
another	1
whipping	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
me	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
cornfield	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
corn	1
was	1
very	1
high	1
it	1
afforded	1
me	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
hiding	1
he	1
seemed	1
very	1
angry	1
and	1
searched	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
my	1
behavior	1
was	1
altogether	1
unaccountable	1
he	1
finally	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
chase	1
thinking	1
i	1
suppose	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
come	1
home	1
for	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
himself	1
no	1
further	1
trouble	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
spent	1
that	1
day	1
mostly	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
having	1
the	1
alternative	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
be	1
whipped	1
to	1
death	1
or	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
be	1
starved	1
to	1
death	1
that	1
night	1
i	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
sandy	1
jenkins	1
a	1
slave	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
somewhat	1
acquainted	1
sandy	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
wife	1
who	1
lived	1
about	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
mr	1
covey	1
s	1
and	1
it	1
being	1
saturday	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
my	1
circumstances	1
and	1
he	1
very	1
kindly	1
invited	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
went	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
talked	1
this	1
whole	1
matter	1
over	1
and	1
got	1
his	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
pursue	1
i	1
found	1
sandy	1
an	1
old	1
adviser	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
with	1
great	1
solemnity	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
covey	1
but	1
that	1
before	1
i	1
went	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
_root	1
_	1
which	1
if	1
i	1
would	1
take	1
some	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
me	1
carrying	1
it	1
_always	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
side	1
_	1
would	1
render	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
mr	1
covey	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
white	1
man	1
to	1
whip	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
received	1
a	1
blow	1
and	1
never	1
expected	1
to	1
while	1
he	1
carried	1
it	1
i	1
at	1
first	1
rejected	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
simple	1
carrying	1
of	1
a	1
root	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
would	1
have	1
any	1
such	1
effect	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
but	1
sandy	1
impressed	1
the	1
necessity	1
with	1
much	1
earnestness	1
telling	1
me	1
it	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
harm	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
i	1
at	1
length	1
took	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
direction	1
carried	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
right	1
side	1
this	1
was	1
sunday	1
morning	1
i	1
immediately	1
started	1
for	1
home	1
and	1
upon	1
entering	1
the	1
yard	1
gate	1
out	1
came	1
mr	1
covey	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
meeting	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
kindly	1
bade	1
me	1
drive	1
the	1
pigs	1
from	1
a	1
lot	1
near	1
by	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
towards	1
the	1
church	1
now	1
this	1
singular	1
conduct	1
of	1
mr	1
covey	1
really	1
made	1
me	1
begin	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
root	1
which	1
sandy	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
day	1
than	1
sunday	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
attributed	1
the	1
conduct	1
to	1
no	1
other	1
cause	1
than	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
root	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
was	1
half	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
_root_	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
at	1
first	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
till	1
monday	1
morning	1
on	1
this	1
morning	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
was	1
fully	1
tested	1
long	1
before	1
daylight	1
i	1
was	1
called	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
rub	1
curry	1
and	1
feed	1
the	1
horses	1
i	1
obeyed	1
and	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
obey	1
but	1
whilst	1
thus	1
engaged	1
whilst	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
throwing	1
down	1
some	1
blades	1
from	1
the	1
loft	1
mr	1
covey	1
entered	1
the	1
stable	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
rope	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
half	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loft	1
he	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
legs	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
tying	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
found	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
up	1
to	1
i	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
spring	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
holding	1
to	1
my	1
legs	1
i	1
was	1
brought	1
sprawling	1
on	1
the	1
stable	1
floor	1
mr	1
covey	1
seemed	1
now	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
me	1
and	1
could	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
pleased	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
spirit	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
fight	1
and	1
suiting	1
my	1
action	1
to	1
the	1
resolution	1
i	1
seized	1
covey	1
hard	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
i	1
rose	1
he	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
to	1
him	1
my	1
resistance	1
was	1
so	1
entirely	1
unexpected	1
that	1
covey	1
seemed	1
taken	1
all	1
aback	1
he	1
trembled	1
like	1
a	1
leaf	1
this	1
gave	1
me	1
assurance	1
and	1
i	1
held	1
him	1
uneasy	1
causing	1
the	1
blood	1
to	1
run	1
where	1
i	1
touched	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
my	1
fingers	1
mr	1
covey	1
soon	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
hughes	1
for	1
help	1
hughes	1
came	1
and	1
while	1
covey	1
held	1
me	1
attempted	1
to	1
tie	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
i	1
watched	1
my	1
chance	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
heavy	1
kick	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
ribs	1
this	1
kick	1
fairly	1
sickened	1
hughes	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
mr	1
covey	1
this	1
kick	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
not	1
only	1
weakening	1
hughes	1
but	1
covey	1
also	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
hughes	1
bending	1
over	1
with	1
pain	1
his	1
courage	1
quailed	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
meant	1
to	1
persist	1
in	1
my	1
resistance	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
did	1
come	1
what	1
might	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
brute	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
so	1
no	1
longer	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
drag	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
stick	1
that	1
was	1
lying	1
just	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stable	1
door	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
knock	1
me	1
down	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
leaning	1
over	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
stick	1
i	1
seized	1
him	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
by	1
his	1
collar	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
snatch	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
bill	1
came	1
covey	1
called	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
assistance	1
bill	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
covey	1
said	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
bill	1
said	1
his	1
master	1
hired	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
help	1
to	1
whip	1
me	1
so	1
he	1
left	1
covey	1
and	1
myself	1
to	1
fight	1
our	1
own	1
battle	1
out	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
it	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
hours	1
covey	1
at	1
length	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
puffing	1
and	1
blowing	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
rate	1
saying	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
resisted	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
whipped	1
me	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
whipped	1
me	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
considered	1
him	1
as	1
getting	1
entirely	1
the	1
worst	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bargain	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
drawn	1
no	1
blood	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
six	1
months	1
afterwards	1
that	1
i	1
spent	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
he	1
never	1
laid	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
finger	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
anger	1
he	1
would	1
occasionally	1
say	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
again	1
no	1
thought	1
i	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
worse	1
than	1
you	1
did	1
before	1
this	1
battle	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
was	1
the	1
turning	1
point	1
in	1
my	1
career	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
it	1
rekindled	1
the	1
few	1
expiring	1
embers	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
revived	1
within	1
me	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
manhood	1
it	1
recalled	1
the	1
departed	1
self	1
confidence	1
and	1
inspired	1
me	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
determination	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
the	1
gratification	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
triumph	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
compensation	1
for	1
whatever	1
else	1
might	1
follow	1
even	1
death	1
itself	1
he	1
only	1
can	1
understand	1
the	1
deep	1
satisfaction	1
which	1
i	1
experienced	1
who	1
has	1
himself	1
repelled	1
by	1
force	1
the	1
bloody	1
arm	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
i	1
never	1
felt	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
glorious	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
slavery	1
to	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
freedom	1
my	1
long	1
crushed	1
spirit	1
rose	1
cowardice	1
departed	1
bold	1
defiance	1
took	1
its	1
place	1
and	1
i	1
now	1
resolved	1
that	1
however	1
long	1
i	1
might	1
remain	1
a	1
slave	1
in	1
form	1
the	1
day	1
had	1
passed	1
forever	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
slave	1
in	1
fact	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
expected	1
to	1
succeed	1
in	1
whipping	1
must	1
also	1
succeed	1
in	1
killing	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
never	1
again	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
fairly	1
whipped	1
though	1
i	1
remained	1
a	1
slave	1
four	1
years	1
afterwards	1
i	1
had	1
several	1
fights	1
but	1
was	1
never	1
whipped	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
surprise	1
to	1
me	1
why	1
mr	1
covey	1
did	1
not	1
immediately	1
have	1
me	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
constable	1
to	1
the	1
whipping	1
post	1
and	1
there	1
regularly	1
whipped	1
for	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
raising	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
explanation	1
i	1
can	1
now	1
think	1
of	1
does	1
not	1
entirely	1
satisfy	1
me	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
mr	1
covey	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
most	1
unbounded	1
reputation	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
first	1
rate	1
overseer	1
and	1
negro	1
breaker	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
considerable	1
importance	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
reputation	1
was	1
at	1
stake	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
a	1
boy	1
about	1
sixteen	1
years	1
old	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
whipping	1
post	1
his	1
reputation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
lost	1
so	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
reputation	1
he	1
suffered	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
unpunished	1
my	1
term	1
of	1
actual	1
service	1
to	1
mr	1
edward	1
covey	1
ended	1
on	1
christmas	1
day	1
1833	1
the	1
days	1
between	1
christmas	1
and	1
new	1
year	1
s	1
day	1
are	1
allowed	1
as	1
holidays	1
and	1
accordingly	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
required	1
to	1
perform	1
any	1
labor	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
feed	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
this	1
time	1
we	1
regarded	1
as	1
our	1
own	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
masters	1
and	1
we	1
therefore	1
used	1
or	1
abused	1
it	1
nearly	1
as	1
we	1
pleased	1
those	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
had	1
families	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
were	1
generally	1
allowed	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
whole	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
their	1
society	1
this	1
time	1
however	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
the	1
staid	1
sober	1
thinking	1
and	1
industrious	1
ones	1
of	1
our	1
number	1
would	1
employ	1
themselves	1
in	1
making	1
corn	1
brooms	1
mats	1
horse	1
collars	1
and	1
baskets	1
and	1
another	1
class	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
hunting	1
opossums	1
hares	1
and	1
coons	1
but	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
larger	1
part	1
engaged	1
in	1
such	1
sports	1
and	1
merriments	1
as	1
playing	1
ball	1
wrestling	1
running	1
foot	1
races	1
fiddling	1
dancing	1
and	1
drinking	1
whisky	1
and	1
this	1
latter	1
mode	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
our	1
masters	1
a	1
slave	1
who	1
would	1
work	1
during	1
the	1
holidays	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
our	1
masters	1
as	1
scarcely	1
deserving	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
rejected	1
the	1
favor	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
it	1
was	1
deemed	1
a	1
disgrace	1
not	1
to	1
get	1
drunk	1
at	1
christmas	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
lazy	1
indeed	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
provided	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
necessary	1
means	1
during	1
the	1
year	1
to	1
get	1
whisky	1
enough	1
to	1
last	1
him	1
through	1
christmas	1
from	1
what	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
these	1
holidays	1
upon	1
the	1
slave	1
i	1
believe	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
effective	1
means	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
slaveholder	1
in	1
keeping	1
down	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
insurrection	1
were	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
abandon	1
this	1
practice	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
doubt	1
it	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
an	1
immediate	1
insurrection	1
among	1
the	1
slaves	1
these	1
holidays	1
serve	1
as	1
conductors	1
or	1
safety	1
valves	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
rebellious	1
spirit	1
of	1
enslaved	1
humanity	1
but	1
for	1
these	1
the	1
slave	1
would	1
be	1
forced	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
wildest	1
desperation	1
and	1
woe	1
betide	1
the	1
slaveholder	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
ventures	1
to	1
remove	1
or	1
hinder	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
those	1
conductors	1
i	1
warn	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
event	1
a	1
spirit	1
will	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
earthquake	1
the	1
holidays	1
are	1
part	1
and	1
parcel	1
of	1
the	1
gross	1
fraud	1
wrong	1
and	1
inhumanity	1
of	1
slavery	1
they	1
are	1
professedly	1
a	1
custom	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
benevolence	1
of	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
but	1
i	1
undertake	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
selfishness	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
grossest	1
frauds	1
committed	1
upon	1
the	1
down	1
trodden	1
slave	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
slaves	1
this	1
time	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
work	1
during	1
its	1
continuance	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unsafe	1
to	1
deprive	1
them	1
of	1
it	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
slaves	1
spend	1
those	1
days	1
just	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
as	1
glad	1
of	1
their	1
ending	1
as	1
of	1
their	1
beginning	1
their	1
object	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
disgust	1
their	1
slaves	1
with	1
freedom	1
by	1
plunging	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
lowest	1
depths	1
of	1
dissipation	1
for	1
instance	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
not	1
only	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
slave	1
drink	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
but	1
will	1
adopt	1
various	1
plans	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
drunk	1
one	1
plan	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
bets	1
on	1
their	1
slaves	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
can	1
drink	1
the	1
most	1
whisky	1
without	1
getting	1
drunk	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
they	1
succeed	1
in	1
getting	1
whole	1
multitudes	1
to	1
drink	1
to	1
excess	1
thus	1
when	1
the	1
slave	1
asks	1
for	1
virtuous	1
freedom	1
the	1
cunning	1
slaveholder	1
knowing	1
his	1
ignorance	1
cheats	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
dose	1
of	1
vicious	1
dissipation	1
artfully	1
labelled	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
liberty	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
used	1
to	1
drink	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
led	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
choose	1
between	1
liberty	1
and	1
slavery	1
we	1
felt	1
and	1
very	1
properly	1
too	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
almost	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
slaves	1
to	1
man	1
as	1
to	1
rum	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
holidays	1
ended	1
we	1
staggered	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
our	1
wallowing	1
took	1
a	1
long	1
breath	1
and	1
marched	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
feeling	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
rather	1
glad	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
what	1
our	1
master	1
had	1
deceived	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
belief	1
was	1
freedom	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
this	1
mode	1
of	1
treatment	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
system	1
of	1
fraud	1
and	1
inhumanity	1
of	1
slavery	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
the	1
mode	1
here	1
adopted	1
to	1
disgust	1
the	1
slave	1
with	1
freedom	1
by	1
allowing	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
only	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
carried	1
out	1
in	1
other	1
things	1
for	1
instance	1
a	1
slave	1
loves	1
molasses	1
he	1
steals	1
some	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
goes	1
off	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
buys	1
a	1
large	1
quantity	1
he	1
returns	1
takes	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
commands	1
the	1
slave	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
molasses	1
until	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
is	1
made	1
sick	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
mention	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
same	1
mode	1
is	1
sometimes	1
adopted	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
slaves	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
for	1
more	1
food	1
than	1
their	1
regular	1
allowance	1
a	1
slave	1
runs	1
through	1
his	1
allowance	1
and	1
applies	1
for	1
more	1
his	1
master	1
is	1
enraged	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
off	1
without	1
food	1
gives	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
compels	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
given	1
time	1
then	1
if	1
he	1
complains	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
eat	1
it	1
he	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
neither	1
full	1
nor	1
fasting	1
and	1
is	1
whipped	1
for	1
being	1
hard	1
to	1
please	1
i	1
have	1
an	1
abundance	1
of	1
such	1
illustrations	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
principle	1
drawn	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
observation	1
but	1
think	1
the	1
cases	1
i	1
have	1
cited	1
sufficient	1
the	1
practice	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
common	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
january	1
1834	1
i	1
left	1
mr	1
covey	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
mr	1
william	1
freeland	1
who	1
lived	1
about	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
i	1
soon	1
found	1
mr	1
freeland	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
mr	1
covey	1
though	1
not	1
rich	1
he	1
was	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
educated	1
southern	1
gentleman	1
mr	1
covey	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
shown	1
was	1
a	1
well	1
trained	1
negro	1
breaker	1
and	1
slave	1
driver	1
the	1
former	1
slaveholder	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
seemed	1
to	1
possess	1
some	1
regard	1
for	1
honor	1
some	1
reverence	1
for	1
justice	1
and	1
some	1
respect	1
for	1
humanity	1
the	1
latter	1
seemed	1
totally	1
insensible	1
to	1
all	1
such	1
sentiments	1
mr	1
freeland	1
had	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
faults	1
peculiar	1
to	1
slaveholders	1
such	1
as	1
being	1
very	1
passionate	1
and	1
fretful	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
do	1
him	1
the	1
justice	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
free	1
from	1
those	1
degrading	1
vices	1
to	1
which	1
mr	1
covey	1
was	1
constantly	1
addicted	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
frank	1
and	1
we	1
always	1
knew	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
artful	1
deceiver	1
and	1
could	1
be	1
understood	1
only	1
by	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
skilful	1
enough	1
to	1
detect	1
his	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
frauds	1
another	1
advantage	1
i	1
gained	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
master	1
was	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
pretensions	1
to	1
or	1
profession	1
of	1
religion	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
was	1
truly	1
a	1
great	1
advantage	1
i	1
assert	1
most	1
unhesitatingly	1
that	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
covering	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
horrid	1
crimes	1
a	1
justifier	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
appalling	1
barbarity	1
a	1
sanctifier	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
hateful	1
frauds	1
and	1
a	1
dark	1
shelter	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
darkest	1
foulest	1
grossest	1
and	1
most	1
infernal	1
deeds	1
of	1
slaveholders	1
find	1
the	1
strongest	1
protection	1
were	1
i	1
to	1
be	1
again	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
slavery	1
next	1
to	1
that	1
enslavement	1
i	1
should	1
regard	1
being	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
a	1
religious	1
master	1
the	1
greatest	1
calamity	1
that	1
could	1
befall	1
me	1
for	1
of	1
all	1
slaveholders	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
met	1
religious	1
slaveholders	1
are	1
the	1
worst	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
found	1
them	1
the	1
meanest	1
and	1
basest	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
and	1
cowardly	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
unhappy	1
lot	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
religious	1
slaveholder	1
but	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
community	1
of	1
such	1
religionists	1
very	1
near	1
mr	1
freeland	1
lived	1
the	1
rev	1
daniel	1
weeden	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
neighborhood	1
lived	1
the	1
rev	1
rigby	1
hopkins	1
these	1
were	1
members	1
and	1
ministers	1
in	1
the	1
reformed	1
methodist	1
church	1
mr	1
weeden	1
owned	1
among	1
others	1
a	1
woman	1
slave	1
whose	1
name	1
i	1
have	1
forgotten	1
this	1
woman	1
s	1
back	1
for	1
weeks	1
was	1
kept	1
literally	1
raw	1
made	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
lash	1
of	1
this	1
merciless	1
_religious_	1
wretch	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
hire	1
hands	1
his	1
maxim	1
was	1
behave	1
well	1
or	1
behave	1
ill	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
master	1
occasionally	1
to	1
whip	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
authority	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
theory	1
and	1
such	1
his	1
practice	1
mr	1
hopkins	1
was	1
even	1
worse	1
than	1
mr	1
weeden	1
his	1
chief	1
boast	1
was	1
his	1
ability	1
to	1
manage	1
slaves	1
the	1
peculiar	1
feature	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
whipping	1
slaves	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
deserving	1
it	1
he	1
always	1
managed	1
to	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
slaves	1
to	1
whip	1
every	1
monday	1
morning	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
to	1
alarm	1
their	1
fears	1
and	1
strike	1
terror	1
into	1
those	1
who	1
escaped	1
his	1
plan	1
was	1
to	1
whip	1
for	1
the	1
smallest	1
offences	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
large	1
ones	1
mr	1
hopkins	1
could	1
always	1
find	1
some	1
excuse	1
for	1
whipping	1
a	1
slave	1
it	1
would	1
astonish	1
one	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
a	1
slaveholding	1
life	1
to	1
see	1
with	1
what	1
wonderful	1
ease	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
can	1
find	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
to	1
make	1
occasion	1
to	1
whip	1
a	1
slave	1
a	1
mere	1
look	1
word	1
or	1
motion	1
a	1
mistake	1
accident	1
or	1
want	1
of	1
power	1
are	1
all	1
matters	1
for	1
which	1
a	1
slave	1
may	1
be	1
whipped	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
does	1
a	1
slave	1
look	1
dissatisfied	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
whipped	1
out	1
does	1
he	1
speak	1
loudly	1
when	1
spoken	1
to	1
by	1
his	1
master	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
getting	1
high	1
minded	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
down	1
a	1
button	1
hole	1
lower	1
does	1
he	1
forget	1
to	1
pull	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
person	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
wanting	1
in	1
reverence	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
whipped	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
he	1
ever	1
venture	1
to	1
vindicate	1
his	1
conduct	1
when	1
censured	1
for	1
it	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
impudence	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
crimes	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
slave	1
can	1
be	1
guilty	1
does	1
he	1
ever	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
a	1
different	1
mode	1
of	1
doing	1
things	1
from	1
that	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
is	1
indeed	1
presumptuous	1
and	1
getting	1
above	1
himself	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
flogging	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
does	1
he	1
while	1
ploughing	1
break	1
a	1
plough	1
or	1
while	1
hoeing	1
break	1
a	1
hoe	1
it	1
is	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
carelessness	1
and	1
for	1
it	1
a	1
slave	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
whipped	1
mr	1
hopkins	1
could	1
always	1
find	1
something	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
lash	1
and	1
he	1
seldom	1
failed	1
to	1
embrace	1
such	1
opportunities	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
county	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
slaves	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
getting	1
their	1
own	1
home	1
would	1
not	1
prefer	1
to	1
live	1
rather	1
than	1
with	1
this	1
rev	1
mr	1
hopkins	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
any	1
where	1
round	1
who	1
made	1
higher	1
professions	1
of	1
religion	1
or	1
was	1
more	1
active	1
in	1
revivals	1
more	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
class	1
love	1
feast	1
prayer	1
and	1
preaching	1
meetings	1
or	1
more	1
devotional	1
in	1
his	1
family	1
that	1
prayed	1
earlier	1
later	1
louder	1
and	1
longer	1
than	1
this	1
same	1
reverend	1
slave	1
driver	1
rigby	1
hopkins	1
but	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
mr	1
freeland	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
experience	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
employment	1
he	1
like	1
mr	1
covey	1
gave	1
us	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
unlike	1
mr	1
covey	1
he	1
also	1
gave	1
us	1
sufficient	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
our	1
meals	1
he	1
worked	1
us	1
hard	1
but	1
always	1
between	1
sunrise	1
and	1
sunset	1
he	1
required	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
gave	1
us	1
good	1
tools	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
work	1
his	1
farm	1
was	1
large	1
but	1
he	1
employed	1
hands	1
enough	1
to	1
work	1
it	1
and	1
with	1
ease	1
compared	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
neighbors	1
my	1
treatment	1
while	1
in	1
his	1
employment	1
was	1
heavenly	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
i	1
experienced	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
mr	1
edward	1
covey	1
mr	1
freeland	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
but	1
two	1
slaves	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
henry	1
harris	1
and	1
john	1
harris	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
hired	1
these	1
consisted	1
of	1
myself	1
sandy	1
jenkins	1
and	1
handy	1
caldwell	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
roots	1
to	1
prevent	1
my	1
being	1
whipped	1
by	1
mr	1
covey	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
soul	1
we	1
used	1
frequently	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
fight	1
with	1
covey	1
and	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
we	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
claim	1
my	1
success	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
this	1
superstition	1
is	1
very	1
common	1
among	1
the	1
more	1
ignorant	1
slaves	1
a	1
slave	1
seldom	1
dies	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
death	1
is	1
attributed	1
to	1
trickery	1
henry	1
and	1
john	1
were	1
quite	1
intelligent	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
creating	1
in	1
them	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
this	1
desire	1
soon	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
others	1
also	1
they	1
very	1
soon	1
mustered	1
up	1
some	1
old	1
spelling	1
books	1
and	1
nothing	1
would	1
do	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
keep	1
a	1
sabbath	1
school	1
i	1
agreed	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
accordingly	1
devoted	1
my	1
sundays	1
to	1
teaching	1
these	1
my	1
loved	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
his	1
letters	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
the	1
neighboring	1
farms	1
found	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
and	1
also	1
availed	1
themselves	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
opportunity	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
among	1
all	1
who	1
came	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
display	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
possible	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
keep	1
our	1
religious	1
masters	1
at	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
sabbath	1
in	1
wrestling	1
boxing	1
and	1
drinking	1
whisky	1
we	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
god	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
much	1
rather	1
see	1
us	1
engaged	1
in	1
those	1
degrading	1
sports	1
than	1
to	1
see	1
us	1
behaving	1
like	1
intellectual	1
moral	1
and	1
accountable	1
beings	1
my	1
blood	1
boils	1
as	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
bloody	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
messrs	1
wright	1
fairbanks	1
and	1
garrison	1
west	1
both	1
class	1
leaders	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
rushed	1
in	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
sticks	1
and	1
stones	1
and	1
broke	1
up	1
our	1
virtuous	1
little	1
sabbath	1
school	1
at	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
all	1
calling	1
themselves	1
christians	1
humble	1
followers	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
jesus	1
christ	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
again	1
digressing	1
i	1
held	1
my	1
sabbath	1
school	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
colored	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
i	1
deem	1
it	1
imprudent	1
to	1
mention	1
for	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
it	1
might	1
embarrass	1
him	1
greatly	1
though	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
holding	1
the	1
school	1
was	1
committed	1
ten	1
years	1
ago	1
i	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
over	1
forty	1
scholars	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
sort	1
ardently	1
desiring	1
to	1
learn	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
all	1
ages	1
though	1
mostly	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
i	1
look	1
back	1
to	1
those	1
sundays	1
with	1
an	1
amount	1
of	1
pleasure	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expressed	1
they	1
were	1
great	1
days	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
instructing	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
was	1
the	1
sweetest	1
engagement	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
ever	1
blessed	1
we	1
loved	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
was	1
a	1
severe	1
cross	1
indeed	1
when	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
these	1
precious	1
souls	1
are	1
to	1
day	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
house	1
of	1
slavery	1
my	1
feelings	1
overcome	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
ask	1
does	1
a	1
righteous	1
god	1
govern	1
the	1
universe	1
and	1
for	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
hold	1
the	1
thunders	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
oppressor	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
spoiled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
spoiler	1
these	1
dear	1
souls	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
sabbath	1
school	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
popular	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
nor	1
did	1
i	1
teach	1
them	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
reputable	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
engaged	1
every	1
moment	1
they	1
spent	1
in	1
that	1
school	1
they	1
were	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
and	1
given	1
thirty	1
nine	1
lashes	1
they	1
came	1
because	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
learn	1
their	1
minds	1
had	1
been	1
starved	1
by	1
their	1
cruel	1
masters	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
mental	1
darkness	1
i	1
taught	1
them	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
be	1
doing	1
something	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
bettering	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
my	1
race	1
i	1
kept	1
up	1
my	1
school	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
year	1
i	1
lived	1
with	1
mr	1
freeland	1
and	1
beside	1
my	1
sabbath	1
school	1
i	1
devoted	1
three	1
evenings	1
in	1
the	1
week	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
to	1
teaching	1
the	1
slaves	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
the	1
happiness	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
sabbath	1
school	1
learned	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
at	1
least	1
is	1
now	1
free	1
through	1
my	1
agency	1
the	1
year	1
passed	1
off	1
smoothly	1
it	1
seemed	1
only	1
about	1
half	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
year	1
which	1
preceded	1
it	1
i	1
went	1
through	1
it	1
without	1
receiving	1
a	1
single	1
blow	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
mr	1
freeland	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
best	1
master	1
i	1
ever	1
had	1
_till	1
i	1
became	1
my	1
own	1
master	1
_	1
for	1
the	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
passed	1
the	1
year	1
i	1
was	1
however	1
somewhat	1
indebted	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
they	1
were	1
noble	1
souls	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
possessed	1
loving	1
hearts	1
but	1
brave	1
ones	1
we	1
were	1
linked	1
and	1
interlinked	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
i	1
loved	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
love	1
stronger	1
than	1
any	1
thing	1
i	1
have	1
experienced	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
slaves	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
and	1
confide	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
assertion	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
i	1
never	1
loved	1
any	1
or	1
confided	1
in	1
any	1
people	1
more	1
than	1
my	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
and	1
especially	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
lived	1
at	1
mr	1
freeland	1
s	1
i	1
believe	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
died	1
for	1
each	1
other	1
we	1
never	1
undertook	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
any	1
importance	1
without	1
a	1
mutual	1
consultation	1
we	1
never	1
moved	1
separately	1
we	1
were	1
one	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
so	1
by	1
our	1
tempers	1
and	1
dispositions	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
hardships	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
necessarily	1
subjected	1
by	1
our	1
condition	1
as	1
slaves	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1834	1
mr	1
freeland	1
again	1
hired	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
for	1
the	1
year	1
1835	1
but	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
live	1
_upon	1
free	1
land_	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
_with	1
freeland	1
_	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
content	1
therefore	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
slaveholder	1
i	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
to	1
prepare	1
myself	1
for	1
a	1
final	1
struggle	1
which	1
should	1
decide	1
my	1
fate	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
my	1
tendency	1
was	1
upward	1
i	1
was	1
fast	1
approaching	1
manhood	1
and	1
year	1
after	1
year	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
slave	1
these	1
thoughts	1
roused	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
do	1
something	1
i	1
therefore	1
resolved	1
that	1
1835	1
should	1
not	1
pass	1
without	1
witnessing	1
an	1
attempt	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
liberty	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
cherish	1
this	1
determination	1
alone	1
my	1
fellow	1
slaves	1
were	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
participate	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
my	1
life	1
giving	1
determination	1
i	1
therefore	1
though	1
with	1
great	1
prudence	1
commenced	1
early	1
to	1
ascertain	1
their	1
views	1
and	1
feelings	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
condition	1
and	1
to	1
imbue	1
their	1
minds	1
with	1
thoughts	1
of	1
freedom	1
i	1
bent	1
myself	1
to	1
devising	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
for	1
our	1
escape	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
strove	1
on	1
all	1
fitting	1
occasions	1
to	1
impress	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
gross	1
fraud	1
and	1
inhumanity	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
henry	1
next	1
to	1
john	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
i	1
found	1
in	1
them	1
all	1
warm	1
hearts	1
and	1
noble	1
spirits	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
act	1
when	1
a	1
feasible	1
plan	1
should	1
be	1
proposed	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
i	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
our	1
want	1
of	1
manhood	1
if	1
we	1
submitted	1
to	1
our	1
enslavement	1
without	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
noble	1
effort	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
we	1
met	1
often	1
and	1
consulted	1
frequently	1
and	1
told	1
our	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears	1
recounted	1
the	1
difficulties	1
real	1
and	1
imagined	1
which	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
times	1
we	1
were	1
almost	1
disposed	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
content	1
ourselves	1
with	1
our	1
wretched	1
lot	1
at	1
others	1
we	1
were	1
firm	1
and	1
unbending	1
in	1
our	1
determination	1
to	1
go	1
whenever	1
we	1
suggested	1
any	1
plan	1
there	1
was	1
shrinking	1
the	1
odds	1
were	1
fearful	1
our	1
path	1
was	1
beset	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
obstacles	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
our	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
was	1
yet	1
questionable	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
returned	1
to	1
bondage	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
spot	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
where	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
free	1
we	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
canada	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
did	1
not	1
extend	1
farther	1
than	1
new	1
york	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
and	1
be	1
forever	1
harassed	1
with	1
the	1
frightful	1
liability	1
of	1
being	1
returned	1
to	1
slavery	1
with	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
being	1
treated	1
tenfold	1
worse	1
than	1
before	1
the	1
thought	1
was	1
truly	1
a	1
horrible	1
one	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
case	1
sometimes	1
stood	1
thus	1
at	1
every	1
gate	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
pass	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
watchman	1
at	1
every	1
ferry	1
a	1
guard	1
on	1
every	1
bridge	1
a	1
sentinel	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
wood	1
a	1
patrol	1
we	1
were	1
hemmed	1
in	1
upon	1
every	1
side	1
here	1
were	1
the	1
difficulties	1
real	1
or	1
imagined	1
the	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
sought	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
to	1
be	1
shunned	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
there	1
stood	1
slavery	1
a	1
stern	1
reality	1
glaring	1
frightfully	1
upon	1
us	1
its	1
robes	1
already	1
crimsoned	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
millions	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
feasting	1
itself	1
greedily	1
upon	1
our	1
own	1
flesh	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
away	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
distance	1
under	1
the	1
flickering	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
star	1
behind	1
some	1
craggy	1
hill	1
or	1
snow	1
covered	1
mountain	1
stood	1
a	1
doubtful	1
freedom	1
half	1
frozen	1
beckoning	1
us	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
share	1
its	1
hospitality	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
was	1
sometimes	1
enough	1
to	1
stagger	1
us	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
permitted	1
ourselves	1
to	1
survey	1
the	1
road	1
we	1
were	1
frequently	1
appalled	1
upon	1
either	1
side	1
we	1
saw	1
grim	1
death	1
assuming	1
the	1
most	1
horrid	1
shapes	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
starvation	1
causing	1
us	1
to	1
eat	1
our	1
own	1
flesh	1
now	1
we	1
were	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
waves	1
and	1
were	1
drowned	1
now	1
we	1
were	1
overtaken	1
and	1
torn	1
to	1
pieces	1
by	1
the	1
fangs	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
bloodhound	1
we	1
were	1
stung	1
by	1
scorpions	1
chased	1
by	1
wild	1
beasts	1
bitten	1
by	1
snakes	1
and	1
finally	1
after	1
having	1
nearly	1
reached	1
the	1
desired	1
spot	1
after	1
swimming	1
rivers	1
encountering	1
wild	1
beasts	1
sleeping	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
suffering	1
hunger	1
and	1
nakedness	1
we	1
were	1
overtaken	1
by	1
our	1
pursuers	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
resistance	1
we	1
were	1
shot	1
dead	1
upon	1
the	1
spot	1
i	1
say	1
this	1
picture	1
sometimes	1
appalled	1
us	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
rather	1
bear	1
those	1
ills	1
we	1
had	1
than	1
fly	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
we	1
knew	1
not	1
of	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
a	1
fixed	1
determination	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
we	1
did	1
more	1
than	1
patrick	1
henry	1
when	1
he	1
resolved	1
upon	1
liberty	1
or	1
death	1
with	1
us	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
doubtful	1
liberty	1
at	1
most	1
and	1
almost	1
certain	1
death	1
if	1
we	1
failed	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
i	1
should	1
prefer	1
death	1
to	1
hopeless	1
bondage	1
sandy	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
number	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
notion	1
but	1
still	1
encouraged	1
us	1
our	1
company	1
then	1
consisted	1
of	1
henry	1
harris	1
john	1
harris	1
henry	1
bailey	1
charles	1
roberts	1
and	1
myself	1
henry	1

was	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
belonged	1
to	1
my	1
master	1

married	1

aunt	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
s	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
mr	1
william	1
hamilton	1
the	1
plan	1
we	1
finally	1
concluded	1
upon	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
large	1
canoe	1
belonging	1
to	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
saturday	1
night	1
previous	1
to	1
easter	1
holidays	1
paddle	1
directly	1
up	1
the	1
chesapeake	1
bay	1
on	1
our	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bay	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
seventy	1
or	1
eighty	1
miles	1
from	1
where	1
we	1
lived	1
it	1
was	1
our	1
purpose	1
to	1
turn	1
our	1
canoe	1
adrift	1
and	1
follow	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
star	1
till	1
we	1
got	1
beyond	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
maryland	1
our	1
reason	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
water	1
route	1
was	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
suspected	1
as	1
runaways	1
we	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
fishermen	1
whereas	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
take	1
the	1
land	1
route	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
interruptions	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
kind	1
any	1
one	1
having	1
a	1
white	1
face	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
disposed	1
could	1
stop	1
us	1
and	1
subject	1
us	1
to	1
examination	1
the	1
week	1
before	1
our	1
intended	1
start	1
i	1
wrote	1
several	1
protections	1
one	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
can	1
remember	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
words	1
to	1
wit	1
this	1
is	1
to	1
certify	1
that	1
i	1
the	1
undersigned	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
bearer	1
my	1
servant	1
full	1
liberty	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
baltimore	1
and	1
spend	1

easter	1
holidays	1
written	1

1835	1
william	1
hamilton	1
near	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
in	1
talbot	1
county	1
maryland	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
baltimore	1
but	1
in	1
going	1
up	1
the	1
bay	1
we	1
went	1
toward	1
baltimore	1
and	1
these	1
protections	1
were	1
only	1
intended	1
to	1
protect	1
us	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
bay	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near	1
for	1
our	1
departure	1
our	1
anxiety	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense	1
it	1
was	1
truly	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
our	1
determination	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
fully	1
tested	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
very	1
active	1
in	1
explaining	1
every	1
difficulty	1
removing	1
every	1
doubt	1
dispelling	1
every	1
fear	1
and	1
inspiring	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
firmness	1
indispensable	1
to	1
success	1
in	1
our	1
undertaking	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
half	1
was	1
gained	1
the	1
instant	1
we	1
made	1
the	1
move	1
we	1
had	1
talked	1
long	1
enough	1
we	1
were	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
move	1
if	1
not	1
now	1
we	1
never	1
should	1
be	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
move	1
now	1
we	1
had	1
as	1
well	1
fold	1
our	1
arms	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
ourselves	1
fit	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
slaves	1
this	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
every	1
man	1
stood	1
firm	1
and	1
at	1
our	1
last	1
meeting	1
we	1
pledged	1
ourselves	1
afresh	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
manner	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
we	1
would	1
certainly	1
start	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
freedom	1
this	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
we	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
our	1
several	1
fields	1
of	1
labor	1
but	1
with	1
bosoms	1
highly	1
agitated	1
with	1
thoughts	1
of	1
our	1
truly	1
hazardous	1
undertaking	1
we	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
our	1
feelings	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
we	1
succeeded	1
very	1
well	1
after	1
a	1
painful	1
waiting	1
the	1
saturday	1
morning	1
whose	1
night	1
was	1
to	1
witness	1
our	1
departure	1
came	1
i	1
hailed	1
it	1
with	1
joy	1
bring	1
what	1
of	1
sadness	1
it	1
might	1
friday	1
night	1
was	1
a	1
sleepless	1
one	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
probably	1
felt	1
more	1
anxious	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
because	1
i	1
was	1
by	1
common	1
consent	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
the	1
responsibility	1
of	1
success	1
or	1
failure	1
lay	1
heavily	1
upon	1
me	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
alike	1
mine	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
hours	1
of	1
that	1
morning	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
never	1
experienced	1
before	1
and	1
hope	1
never	1
to	1
again	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
we	1
went	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
we	1
were	1
spreading	1
manure	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
while	1
thus	1
engaged	1
i	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
an	1
indescribable	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
turned	1
to	1
sandy	1
who	1
was	1
near	1
by	1
and	1
said	1
we	1
are	1
betrayed	1
well	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
thought	1
has	1
this	1
moment	1
struck	1
me	1
we	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
i	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
certain	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
the	1
horn	1
was	1
blown	1
as	1
usual	1
and	1
we	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
breakfast	1
i	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
form	1
more	1
than	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
morning	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
looking	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
lane	1
gate	1
i	1
saw	1
four	1
white	1
men	1
with	1
two	1
colored	1
men	1
the	1
white	1
men	1
were	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
the	1
colored	1
ones	1
were	1
walking	1
behind	1
as	1
if	1
tied	1
i	1
watched	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
till	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
lane	1
gate	1
here	1
they	1
halted	1
and	1
tied	1
the	1
colored	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
post	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
certain	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
in	1
rode	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
with	1
a	1
speed	1
betokening	1
great	1
excitement	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
inquired	1
if	1
master	1
william	1
was	1
in	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
barn	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
without	1
dismounting	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
barn	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
speed	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
and	1
mr	1
freeland	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
three	1
constables	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
dismounted	1
tied	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
met	1
master	1
william	1
and	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
barn	1
and	1
after	1
talking	1
awhile	1
they	1
all	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
but	1
myself	1
and	1
john	1
henry	1
and	1
sandy	1
were	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
barn	1
mr	1
freeland	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
name	1
saying	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
gentlemen	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
i	1
stepped	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
inquired	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
they	1
at	1
once	1
seized	1
me	1
and	1
without	1
giving	1
me	1
any	1
satisfaction	1
tied	1
me	1
lashing	1
my	1
hands	1
closely	1
together	1
i	1
insisted	1
upon	1
knowing	1
what	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
they	1
at	1
length	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
learned	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
scrape	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
examined	1
before	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
information	1
proved	1
false	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
they	1
succeeded	1
in	1
tying	1
john	1
they	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
henry	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
returned	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
cross	1
his	1
hands	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
said	1
henry	1
in	1
a	1
firm	1
tone	1
indicating	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
his	1
refusal	1
won	1
t	1
you	1
said	1
tom	1
graham	1
the	1
constable	1
no	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
said	1
henry	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
stronger	1
tone	1
with	1
this	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
constables	1
pulled	1
out	1
their	1
shining	1
pistols	1
and	1
swore	1
by	1
their	1
creator	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
cross	1
his	1
hands	1
or	1
kill	1
him	1
each	1
cocked	1
his	1
pistol	1
and	1
with	1
fingers	1
on	1
the	1
trigger	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
henry	1
saying	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cross	1
his	1
hands	1
they	1
would	1
blow	1
his	1
damned	1
heart	1
out	1
shoot	1
me	1
shoot	1
me	1
said	1
henry	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
kill	1
me	1
but	1
once	1
shoot	1
shoot	1
and	1
be	1
damned	1
_i	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
tied	1
_	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
loud	1
defiance	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
motion	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
lightning	1
he	1
with	1
one	1
single	1
stroke	1
dashed	1
the	1
pistols	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
each	1
constable	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
all	1
hands	1
fell	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
beating	1
him	1
some	1
time	1
they	1
finally	1
overpowered	1
him	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
tied	1
during	1
the	1
scuffle	1
i	1
managed	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
my	1
pass	1
out	1
and	1
without	1
being	1
discovered	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
now	1
tied	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
for	1
easton	1
jail	1
betsy	1
freeland	1
mother	1
of	1
william	1
freeland	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
full	1
of	1
biscuits	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
between	1
henry	1
and	1
john	1
she	1
then	1
delivered	1
herself	1
of	1
a	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
effect	1
addressing	1
herself	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
said	1
_you	1
devil	1
you	1
yellow	1
devil	1
_	1
it	1
was	1
you	1
that	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
henry	1
and	1
john	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
for	1
you	1
you	1
long	1
legged	1
mulatto	1
devil	1
henry	1
nor	1
john	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
i	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
hurried	1
off	1
towards	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
just	1
a	1
moment	1
previous	1
to	1
the	1
scuffle	1
with	1
henry	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
suggested	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
protections	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
frederick	1
had	1
written	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
carrying	1
his	1
proposal	1
into	1
effect	1
his	1
aid	1
was	1
needed	1
in	1
helping	1
to	1
tie	1
henry	1
and	1
the	1
excitement	1
attending	1
the	1
scuffle	1
caused	1
them	1
either	1
to	1
forget	1
or	1
to	1
deem	1
it	1
unsafe	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
to	1
search	1
so	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
convicted	1
of	1
the	1
intention	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
about	1
half	1
way	1
to	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
while	1
the	1
constables	1
having	1
us	1
in	1
charge	1
were	1
looking	1
ahead	1
henry	1
inquired	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
pass	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
biscuit	1
and	1
own	1
nothing	1
and	1
we	1
passed	1
the	1
word	1
around	1
_own	1
nothing	1
_	1
and	1
_own	1
nothing	1
_	1
said	1
we	1
all	1
our	1
confidence	1
in	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
unshaken	1
we	1
were	1
resolved	1
to	1
succeed	1
or	1
fail	1
together	1
after	1
the	1
calamity	1
had	1
befallen	1
us	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
before	1
we	1
were	1
now	1
prepared	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
dragged	1
that	1
morning	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
behind	1
horses	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
easton	1
jail	1
when	1
we	1
reached	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
we	1
underwent	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
examination	1
we	1
all	1
denied	1
that	1
we	1
ever	1
intended	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
we	1
did	1
this	1
more	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
evidence	1
against	1
us	1
than	1
from	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
clear	1
of	1
being	1
sold	1
for	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
we	1
were	1
ready	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
we	1
cared	1
but	1
little	1
where	1
we	1
went	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
together	1
our	1
greatest	1
concern	1
was	1
about	1
separation	1
we	1
dreaded	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
thing	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
death	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
evidence	1
against	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
one	1
person	1
our	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
unanimous	1
decision	1
among	1
ourselves	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
their	1
informant	1
was	1
we	1
were	1
sent	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
jail	1
at	1
easton	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
there	1
we	1
were	1
delivered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sheriff	1
mr	1
joseph	1
graham	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
placed	1
in	1
jail	1
henry	1
john	1
and	1
myself	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
one	1
room	1
together	1
charles	1
and	1
henry	1
bailey	1
in	1
another	1
their	1
object	1
in	1
separating	1
us	1
was	1
to	1
hinder	1
concert	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
jail	1
scarcely	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
when	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
slave	1
traders	1
and	1
agents	1
for	1
slave	1
traders	1
flocked	1
into	1
jail	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
us	1
and	1
to	1
ascertain	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
for	1
sale	1
such	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
beings	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
before	1
i	1
felt	1
myself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
fiends	1
from	1
perdition	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
pirates	1
never	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
their	1
father	1
the	1
devil	1
they	1
laughed	1
and	1
grinned	1
over	1
us	1
saying	1
ah	1
my	1
boys	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
we	1
and	1
after	1
taunting	1
us	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
they	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
went	1
into	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
intent	1
to	1
ascertain	1
our	1
value	1
they	1
would	1
impudently	1
ask	1
us	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
for	1
our	1
masters	1
we	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
no	1
answer	1
and	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
as	1
best	1
they	1
could	1
then	1
they	1
would	1
curse	1
and	1
swear	1
at	1
us	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
take	1
the	1
devil	1
out	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
only	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
while	1
in	1
jail	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
much	1
more	1
comfortable	1
quarters	1
than	1
we	1
expected	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
there	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
much	1
to	1
eat	1
nor	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
clean	1
room	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
damp	1
cells	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
we	1
got	1
along	1
very	1
well	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
jail	1
and	1
its	1
keeper	1
were	1
concerned	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
holidays	1
were	1
over	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
our	1
expectations	1
mr	1
hamilton	1
and	1
mr	1
freeland	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
easton	1
and	1
took	1
charles	1
the	1
two	1
henrys	1
and	1
john	1
out	1
of	1
jail	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
home	1
leaving	1
me	1
alone	1
i	1
regarded	1
this	1
separation	1
as	1
a	1
final	1
one	1
it	1
caused	1
me	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
any	1
thing	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
transaction	1
i	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
any	1
thing	1
rather	1
than	1
separation	1
i	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
consulted	1
together	1
and	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
whole	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
innocent	1
suffer	1
with	1
the	1
guilty	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
therefore	1
concluded	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
others	1
home	1
and	1
sell	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
warning	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
remained	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
noble	1
henry	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
reluctant	1
at	1
leaving	1
the	1
prison	1
as	1
at	1
leaving	1
home	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
but	1
we	1
knew	1
we	1
should	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
be	1
separated	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
sold	1
and	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
he	1
concluded	1
to	1
go	1
peaceably	1
home	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
left	1
to	1
my	1
fate	1
i	1
was	1
all	1
alone	1
and	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
stone	1
prison	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
hope	1
i	1
expected	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
safe	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
freedom	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
gloom	1
sunk	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
despair	1
i	1
thought	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
freedom	1
was	1
gone	1
i	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
about	1
one	1
week	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
captain	1
auld	1
my	1
master	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
and	1
utter	1
astonishment	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
sending	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
into	1
alabama	1
but	1
from	1
some	1
cause	1
or	1
other	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
alabama	1
but	1
concluded	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
back	1
to	1
baltimore	1
to	1
live	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
hugh	1
and	1
to	1
learn	1
a	1
trade	1
thus	1
after	1
an	1
absence	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
one	1
month	1
i	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
permitted	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
home	1
at	1
baltimore	1
my	1
master	1
sent	1
me	1
away	1
because	1
there	1
existed	1
against	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
prejudice	1
in	1
the	1
community	1
and	1
he	1
feared	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
baltimore	1
master	1
hugh	1
hired	1
me	1
to	1
mr	1
william	1
gardner	1
an	1
extensive	1
ship	1
builder	1
on	1
fell	1
s	1
point	1
i	1
was	1
put	1
there	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
calk	1
it	1
however	1
proved	1
a	1
very	1
unfavorable	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
this	1
object	1
mr	1
gardner	1
was	1
engaged	1
that	1
spring	1
in	1
building	1
two	1
large	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
brigs	1
professedly	1
for	1
the	1
mexican	1
government	1
the	1
vessels	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
launched	1
in	1
the	1
july	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
and	1
in	1
failure	1
thereof	1
mr	1
gardner	1
was	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
entered	1
all	1
was	1
hurry	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
learn	1
any	1
thing	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1

out	1
this	1
was	1
my	1
school	1
for	1
eight	1
months	1
and	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
remained	1
there	1
longer	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
most	1
horrid	1
fight	1
i	1
had	1
with	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
apprentices	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
left	1
eye	1
was	1
nearly	1
knocked	1
out	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
horribly	1
mangled	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
the	1
facts	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
were	1
these	1
until	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
there	1
white	1
and	1
black	1
ship	1
carpenters	1
worked	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
impropriety	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
hands	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
carpenters	1
were	1
freemen	1
things	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
on	1
very	1
well	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
white	1
carpenters	1
knocked	1
off	1
and	1
said	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
work	1
with	1
free	1
colored	1
workmen	1
their	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
as	1
alleged	1
was	1
that	1
if	1
free	1
colored	1
carpenters	1
were	1
encouraged	1
they	1
would	1
soon	1
take	1
the	1
trade	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
poor	1
white	1
men	1
would	1
be	1
thrown	1
out	1
of	1
employment	1
they	1
therefore	1
felt	1
called	1
upon	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
necessities	1
they	1
broke	1
off	1
swearing	1
they	1
would	1
work	1
no	1
longer	1
unless	1
he	1
would	1
discharge	1
his	1
black	1
carpenters	1
now	1
though	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
extend	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
form	1
it	1
did	1
reach	1
me	1
in	1
fact	1
my	1
fellow	1
apprentices	1
very	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
it	1
degrading	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
me	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
airs	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
niggers	1
taking	1
the	1
country	1
saying	1
we	1
all	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
and	1
being	1
encouraged	1
by	1
the	1
journeymen	1
they	1
commenced	1
making	1
my	1
condition	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
by	1
hectoring	1
me	1
around	1
and	1
sometimes	1
striking	1
me	1
i	1
of	1
course	1
kept	1
the	1
vow	1
i	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
fight	1
with	1
mr	1
covey	1
and	1
struck	1
back	1
again	1
regardless	1
of	1
consequences	1
and	1
while	1
i	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
combining	1
i	1
succeeded	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
whip	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them	1
taking	1
them	1
separately	1
they	1
however	1
at	1
length	1
combined	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
armed	1
with	1
sticks	1
stones	1
and	1
heavy	1
handspikes	1
one	1
came	1
in	1
front	1
with	1
a	1
half	1
brick	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
one	1
behind	1
me	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
attending	1
to	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
the	1
one	1
behind	1
ran	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
handspike	1
and	1
struck	1
me	1
a	1
heavy	1
blow	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
it	1
stunned	1
me	1
i	1
fell	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
they	1
all	1
ran	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
beating	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
fists	1
i	1
let	1
them	1
lay	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
gathering	1
strength	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
i	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
surge	1
and	1
rose	1
to	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
gave	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
boot	1
a	1
powerful	1
kick	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
eye	1
my	1
eyeball	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
burst	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
my	1
eye	1
closed	1
and	1
badly	1
swollen	1
they	1
left	1
me	1
with	1
this	1
i	1
seized	1
the	1
handspike	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
pursued	1
them	1
but	1
here	1
the	1
carpenters	1
interfered	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stand	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
so	1
many	1
all	1
this	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
fifty	1
white	1
ship	1
carpenters	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
interposed	1
a	1
friendly	1
word	1
but	1
some	1
cried	1
kill	1
the	1
damned	1
nigger	1
kill	1
him	1
kill	1
him	1
he	1
struck	1
a	1
white	1
person	1
i	1
found	1
my	1
only	1
chance	1
for	1
life	1
was	1
in	1
flight	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
away	1
without	1
an	1
additional	1
blow	1
and	1
barely	1
so	1
for	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
is	1
death	1
by	1
lynch	1
law	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
much	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
out	1
of	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
i	1
went	1
directly	1
home	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
wrongs	1
to	1
master	1
hugh	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
irreligious	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
conduct	1
was	1
heavenly	1
compared	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
thomas	1
under	1
similar	1
circumstances	1
he	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
my	1
narration	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
savage	1
outrage	1
and	1
gave	1
many	1
proofs	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
indignation	1
at	1
it	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
my	1
once	1
overkind	1
mistress	1
was	1
again	1
melted	1
into	1
pity	1
my	1
puffed	1
out	1
eye	1
and	1
blood	1
covered	1
face	1
moved	1
her	1
to	1
tears	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
chair	1
by	1
me	1
washed	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
my	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mother	1
s	1
tenderness	1
bound	1
up	1
my	1
head	1
covering	1
the	1
wounded	1
eye	1
with	1
a	1
lean	1
piece	1
of	1
fresh	1
beef	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
compensation	1
for	1
my	1
suffering	1
to	1
witness	1
once	1
more	1
a	1
manifestation	1
of	1
kindness	1
from	1
this	1
my	1
once	1
affectionate	1
old	1
mistress	1
master	1
hugh	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
enraged	1
he	1
gave	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
by	1
pouring	1
out	1
curses	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
the	1
deed	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
little	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
my	1
bruises	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
esquire	1
watson	1
s	1
on	1
bond	1
street	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
mr	1
watson	1
inquired	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
assault	1
committed	1
master	1
hugh	1
told	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
ship	1
yard	1
at	1
midday	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
large	1
company	1
of	1
men	1
at	1
work	1
as	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
deed	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
did	1
it	1
his	1
answer	1
was	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
unless	1
some	1
white	1
man	1
would	1
come	1
forward	1
and	1
testify	1
he	1
could	1
issue	1
no	1
warrant	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
colored	1
people	1
their	1
testimony	1
combined	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
insufficient	1
to	1
have	1
arrested	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
murderers	1
master	1
hugh	1
for	1
once	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
was	1
too	1
bad	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
any	1
white	1
man	1
to	1
volunteer	1
his	1
testimony	1
in	1
my	1
behalf	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
white	1
young	1
men	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
sympathized	1
with	1
me	1
were	1
not	1
prepared	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
it	1
required	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
courage	1
unknown	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
for	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
slightest	1
manifestation	1
of	1
humanity	1
toward	1
a	1
colored	1
person	1
was	1
denounced	1
as	1
abolitionism	1
and	1
that	1
name	1
subjected	1
its	1
bearer	1
to	1
frightful	1
liabilities	1
the	1
watchwords	1
of	1
the	1
bloody	1
minded	1
in	1
that	1
region	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
damn	1
the	1
abolitionists	1
and	1
damn	1
the	1
niggers	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
done	1
and	1
probably	1
nothing	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
such	1
was	1
and	1
such	1
remains	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
christian	1
city	1
of	1
baltimore	1
master	1
hugh	1
finding	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
redress	1
refused	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
mr	1
gardner	1
he	1
kept	1
me	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
dressed	1
my	1
wound	1
till	1
i	1
was	1
again	1
restored	1
to	1
health	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
yard	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
foreman	1
in	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
mr	1
walter	1
price	1
there	1
i	1
was	1
immediately	1
set	1
to	1
calking	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
learned	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
using	1
my	1
mallet	1
and	1
irons	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
one	1
year	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
i	1
left	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
i	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
highest	1
wages	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
experienced	1
calkers	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
of	1
some	1
importance	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
i	1
was	1
bringing	1
him	1
from	1
six	1
to	1
seven	1
dollars	1
per	1
week	1
i	1
sometimes	1
brought	1
him	1
nine	1
dollars	1
per	1
week	1
my	1
wages	1
were	1
a	1
dollar	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
a	1
day	1
after	1
learning	1
how	1
to	1
calk	1
i	1
sought	1
my	1
own	1
employment	1
made	1
my	1
own	1
contracts	1
and	1
collected	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
i	1
earned	1
my	1
pathway	1
became	1
much	1
more	1
smooth	1
than	1
before	1
my	1
condition	1
was	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
comfortable	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
calking	1
to	1
do	1
i	1
did	1
nothing	1
during	1
these	1
leisure	1
times	1
those	1
old	1
notions	1
about	1
freedom	1
would	1
steal	1
over	1
me	1
again	1
when	1
in	1
mr	1
gardner	1
s	1
employment	1
i	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
perpetual	1
whirl	1
of	1
excitement	1
i	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
scarcely	1
but	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
thinking	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
i	1
almost	1
forgot	1
my	1
liberty	1
i	1
have	1
observed	1
this	1
in	1
my	1
experience	1
of	1
slavery	1
that	1
whenever	1
my	1
condition	1
was	1
improved	1
instead	1
of	1
its	1
increasing	1
my	1
contentment	1
it	1
only	1
increased	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
to	1
thinking	1
of	1
plans	1
to	1
gain	1
my	1
freedom	1
i	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
contented	1
slave	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
thoughtless	1
one	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
darken	1
his	1
moral	1
and	1
mental	1
vision	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
annihilate	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
reason	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
detect	1
no	1
inconsistencies	1
in	1
slavery	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
slavery	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
he	1

i	1
was	1
now	1
getting	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
one	1
dollar	1
and	1
fifty	1
cents	1
per	1
day	1
i	1
contracted	1
for	1
it	1
i	1
earned	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
paid	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
rightfully	1
my	1
own	1
yet	1
upon	1
each	1
returning	1
saturday	1
night	1
i	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
deliver	1
every	1
cent	1
of	1
that	1
money	1
to	1
master	1
hugh	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
earned	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
hand	1
in	1
earning	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
i	1
owed	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
nor	1
because	1
he	1
possessed	1
the	1
slightest	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
solely	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
compel	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
grim	1
visaged	1
pirate	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
seas	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
chapter	1
xi	1
i	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
planned	1
and	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
my	1
escape	1
from	1
slavery	1
but	1
before	1
narrating	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
peculiar	1
circumstances	1
i	1
deem	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
my	1
intention	1
not	1
to	1
state	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
transaction	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
pursuing	1
this	1
course	1
may	1
be	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
following	1
first	1
were	1
i	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
minute	1
statement	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
possible	1
but	1
quite	1
probable	1
that	1
others	1
would	1
thereby	1
be	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
embarrassing	1
difficulties	1
secondly	1
such	1
a	1
statement	1
would	1
most	1
undoubtedly	1
induce	1
greater	1
vigilance	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
slaveholders	1
than	1
has	1
existed	1
heretofore	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
guarding	1
a	1
door	1
whereby	1
some	1
dear	1
brother	1
bondman	1
might	1
escape	1
his	1
galling	1
chains	1
i	1
deeply	1
regret	1
the	1
necessity	1
that	1
impels	1
me	1
to	1
suppress	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
importance	1
connected	1
with	1
my	1
experience	1
in	1
slavery	1
it	1
would	1
afford	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure	1
indeed	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
materially	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
my	1
narrative	1
were	1
i	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
gratify	1
a	1
curiosity	1
which	1
i	1
know	1
exists	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
many	1
by	1
an	1
accurate	1
statement	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
pertaining	1
to	1
my	1
most	1
fortunate	1
escape	1
but	1
i	1
must	1
deprive	1
myself	1
of	1
this	1
pleasure	1
and	1
the	1
curious	1
of	1
the	1
gratification	1
which	1
such	1
a	1
statement	1
would	1
afford	1
i	1
would	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
suffer	1
under	1
the	1
greatest	1
imputations	1
which	1
evil	1
minded	1
men	1
might	1
suggest	1
rather	1
than	1
exculpate	1
myself	1
and	1
thereby	1
run	1
the	1
hazard	1
of	1
closing	1
the	1
slightest	1
avenue	1
by	1
which	1
a	1
brother	1
slave	1
might	1
clear	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
chains	1
and	1
fetters	1
of	1
slavery	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
approved	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
public	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
western	1
friends	1
have	1
conducted	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
_underground	1
railroad	1
_	1
but	1
which	1
i	1
think	1
by	1
their	1
open	1
declarations	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
most	1
emphatically	1
the	1
_upper	1
ground	1
railroad	1
_	1
i	1
honor	1
those	1
good	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
for	1
their	1
noble	1
daring	1
and	1
applaud	1
them	1
for	1
willingly	1
subjecting	1
themselves	1
to	1
bloody	1
persecution	1
by	1
openly	1
avowing	1
their	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
slaves	1
i	1
however	1
can	1
see	1
very	1
little	1
good	1
resulting	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
course	1
either	1
to	1
themselves	1
or	1
the	1
slaves	1
escaping	1
while	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
i	1
see	1
and	1
feel	1
assured	1
that	1
those	1
open	1
declarations	1
are	1
a	1
positive	1
evil	1
to	1
the	1
slaves	1
remaining	1
who	1
are	1
seeking	1
to	1
escape	1
they	1
do	1
nothing	1
towards	1
enlightening	1
the	1
slave	1
whilst	1
they	1
do	1
much	1
towards	1
enlightening	1
the	1
master	1
they	1
stimulate	1
him	1
to	1
greater	1
watchfulness	1
and	1
enhance	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
capture	1
his	1
slave	1
we	1
owe	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
slave	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
north	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
aiding	1
the	1
latter	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
freedom	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
hinder	1
the	1
former	1
from	1
escaping	1
from	1
slavery	1
i	1
would	1
keep	1
the	1
merciless	1
slaveholder	1
profoundly	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
flight	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
slave	1
i	1
would	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
imagine	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
myriads	1
of	1
invisible	1
tormentors	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
snatch	1
from	1
his	1
infernal	1
grasp	1
his	1
trembling	1
prey	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
feel	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
let	1
darkness	1
commensurate	1
with	1
his	1
crime	1
hover	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
takes	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
bondman	1
he	1
is	1
running	1
the	1
frightful	1
risk	1
of	1
having	1
his	1
hot	1
brains	1
dashed	1
out	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
agency	1
let	1
us	1
render	1
the	1
tyrant	1
no	1
aid	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
hold	1
the	1
light	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
can	1
trace	1
the	1
footprints	1
of	1
our	1
flying	1
brother	1
but	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
i	1
will	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
statement	1
of	1
those	1
facts	1
connected	1
with	1
my	1
escape	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
alone	1
responsible	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
suffer	1
but	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1838	1
i	1
became	1
quite	1
restless	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each	1
week	1
pour	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
toil	1
into	1
the	1
purse	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
when	1
i	1
carried	1
to	1
him	1
my	1
weekly	1
wages	1
he	1
would	1
after	1
counting	1
the	1
money	1
look	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
robber	1
like	1
fierceness	1
and	1
ask	1
is	1
this	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
cent	1
he	1
would	1
however	1
when	1
i	1
made	1
him	1
six	1
dollars	1
sometimes	1
give	1
me	1
six	1
cents	1
to	1
encourage	1
me	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
opposite	1
effect	1
i	1
regarded	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
admission	1
of	1
my	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
wages	1
was	1
proof	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
me	1
entitled	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them	1
i	1
always	1
felt	1
worse	1
for	1
having	1
received	1
any	1
thing	1
for	1
i	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
giving	1
me	1
a	1
few	1
cents	1
would	1
ease	1
his	1
conscience	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
pretty	1
honorable	1
sort	1
of	1
robber	1
my	1
discontent	1
grew	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
and	1
finding	1
no	1
direct	1
means	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
hire	1
my	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
getting	1
money	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
escape	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
1838	1
when	1
master	1
thomas	1
came	1
to	1
baltimore	1
to	1
purchase	1
his	1
spring	1
goods	1
i	1
got	1
an	1
opportunity	1
and	1
applied	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
hire	1
my	1
time	1
he	1
unhesitatingly	1
refused	1
my	1
request	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
this	1
was	1
another	1
stratagem	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
escape	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
go	1
nowhere	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
my	1
running	1
away	1
he	1
should	1
spare	1
no	1
pains	1
in	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
catch	1
me	1
he	1
exhorted	1
me	1
to	1
content	1
myself	1
and	1
be	1
obedient	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
happy	1
i	1
must	1
lay	1
out	1
no	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
i	1
behaved	1
myself	1
properly	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
indeed	1
he	1
advised	1
me	1
to	1
complete	1
thoughtlessness	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
and	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
depend	1
solely	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
happiness	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
fully	1
the	1
pressing	1
necessity	1
of	1
setting	1
aside	1
my	1
intellectual	1
nature	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
contentment	1
in	1
slavery	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
myself	1
i	1
continued	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
my	1
enslavement	1
and	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
about	1
two	1
months	1
after	1
this	1
i	1
applied	1
to	1
master	1
hugh	1
for	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
hiring	1
my	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
applied	1
to	1
master	1
thomas	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
refused	1
he	1
too	1
at	1
first	1
seemed	1
disposed	1
to	1
refuse	1
but	1
after	1
some	1
reflection	1
he	1
granted	1
me	1
the	1
privilege	1
and	1
proposed	1
the	1
following	1
terms	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
all	1
my	1
time	1
make	1
all	1
contracts	1
with	1
those	1
for	1
whom	1
i	1
worked	1
and	1
find	1
my	1
own	1
employment	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
this	1
liberty	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
three	1
dollars	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each	1
week	1
find	1
myself	1
in	1
calking	1
tools	1
and	1
in	1
board	1
and	1
clothing	1
my	1
board	1
was	1
two	1
dollars	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
per	1
week	1
this	1
with	1
the	1
wear	1
and	1
tear	1
of	1
clothing	1
and	1
calking	1
tools	1
made	1
my	1
regular	1
expenses	1
about	1
six	1
dollars	1
per	1
week	1
this	1
amount	1
i	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
or	1
relinquish	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
hiring	1
my	1
time	1
rain	1
or	1
shine	1
work	1
or	1
no	1
work	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each	1
week	1
the	1
money	1
must	1
be	1
forthcoming	1
or	1
i	1
must	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
privilege	1
this	1
arrangement	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
perceived	1
was	1
decidedly	1
in	1
my	1
master	1
s	1
favor	1
it	1
relieved	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
need	1
of	1
looking	1
after	1
me	1
his	1
money	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
received	1
all	1
the	1
benefits	1
of	1
slaveholding	1
without	1
its	1
evils	1
while	1
i	1
endured	1
all	1
the	1
evils	1
of	1
a	1
slave	1
and	1
suffered	1
all	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
anxiety	1
of	1
a	1
freeman	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
a	1
hard	1
bargain	1
but	1
hard	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
old	1
mode	1
of	1
getting	1
along	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
step	1
towards	1
freedom	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
responsibilities	1
of	1
a	1
freeman	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
hold	1
on	1
upon	1
it	1
i	1
bent	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
making	1
money	1
i	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
night	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
untiring	1
perseverance	1
and	1
industry	1
i	1
made	1
enough	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
expenses	1
and	1
lay	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
money	1
every	1
week	1
i	1
went	1
on	1
thus	1
from	1
may	1
till	1
august	1
master	1
hugh	1
then	1
refused	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
hire	1
my	1
time	1
longer	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
his	1
refusal	1
was	1
a	1
failure	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
one	1
saturday	1
night	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
for	1
my	1
week	1
s	1
time	1
this	1
failure	1
was	1
occasioned	1
by	1
my	1
attending	1
a	1
camp	1
meeting	1
about	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
baltimore	1
during	1
the	1
week	1
i	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
engagement	1
with	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
young	1
friends	1
to	1
start	1
from	1
baltimore	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
ground	1
early	1
saturday	1
evening	1
and	1
being	1
detained	1
by	1
my	1
employer	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
get	1
down	1
to	1
master	1
hugh	1
s	1
without	1
disappointing	1
the	1
company	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
master	1
hugh	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
special	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
night	1
i	1
therefore	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
camp	1
meeting	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
return	1
pay	1
him	1
the	1
three	1
dollars	1
i	1
staid	1
at	1
the	1
camp	1
meeting	1
one	1
day	1
longer	1
than	1
i	1
intended	1
when	1
i	1
left	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
returned	1
i	1
called	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
considered	1
his	1
due	1
i	1
found	1
him	1
very	1
angry	1
he	1
could	1
scarce	1
restrain	1
his	1
wrath	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
mind	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
severe	1
whipping	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
i	1
dared	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
without	1
asking	1
his	1
permission	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
hired	1
my	1
time	1
and	1
while	1
i	1
paid	1
him	1
the	1
price	1
which	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
it	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
i	1
should	1
go	1
this	1
reply	1
troubled	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
reflecting	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
should	1
hire	1
my	1
time	1
no	1
longer	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
thing	1
he	1
should	1
know	1
of	1
i	1
would	1
be	1
running	1
away	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
plea	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
my	1
tools	1
and	1
clothing	1
home	1
forthwith	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
seeking	1
work	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
previously	1
to	1
hiring	1
my	1
time	1
i	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
week	1
without	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
stroke	1
of	1
work	1
i	1
did	1
this	1
in	1
retaliation	1
saturday	1
night	1
he	1
called	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
usual	1
for	1
my	1
week	1
s	1
wages	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
wages	1
i	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
work	1
that	1
week	1
here	1
we	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
blows	1
he	1
raved	1
and	1
swore	1
his	1
determination	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
but	1
was	1
resolved	1
if	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
me	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
blow	1
for	1
blow	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
strike	1
me	1
but	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
constant	1
employment	1
in	1
future	1
i	1
thought	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
during	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
sunday	1
and	1
finally	1
resolved	1
upon	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
of	1
september	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
upon	1
which	1
i	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
second	1
attempt	1
to	1
secure	1
my	1
freedom	1
i	1
now	1
had	1
three	1
weeks	1
during	1
which	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
my	1
journey	1
early	1
on	1
monday	1
morning	1
before	1
master	1
hugh	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
engagement	1
for	1
me	1
i	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
got	1
employment	1
of	1
mr	1
butler	1
at	1
his	1
ship	1
yard	1
near	1
the	1
drawbridge	1
upon	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
city	1
block	1
thus	1
making	1
it	1
unnecessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
seek	1
employment	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
i	1
brought	1
him	1
between	1
eight	1
and	1
nine	1
dollars	1
he	1
seemed	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
and	1
asked	1
why	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
week	1
before	1
he	1
little	1
knew	1
what	1
my	1
plans	1
were	1
my	1
object	1
in	1
working	1
steadily	1
was	1
to	1
remove	1
any	1
suspicion	1
he	1
might	1
entertain	1
of	1
my	1
intent	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
i	1
succeeded	1
admirably	1
i	1
suppose	1
he	1
thought	1
i	1
was	1
never	1
better	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
condition	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
planning	1
my	1
escape	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
passed	1
and	1
again	1
i	1
carried	1
him	1
my	1
full	1
wages	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
twenty	1
five	1
cents	1
quite	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
for	1
a	1
slaveholder	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
slave	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
use	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
would	1
things	1
went	1
on	1
without	1
very	1
smoothly	1
indeed	1
but	1
within	1
there	1
was	1
trouble	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
describe	1
my	1
feelings	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
contemplated	1
start	1
drew	1
near	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
warmhearted	1
friends	1
in	1
baltimore	1
friends	1
that	1
i	1
loved	1
almost	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
separated	1
from	1
them	1
forever	1
was	1
painful	1
beyond	1
expression	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
that	1
thousands	1
would	1
escape	1
from	1
slavery	1
who	1
now	1
remain	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
strong	1
cords	1
of	1
affection	1
that	1
bind	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
friends	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
leaving	1
my	1
friends	1
was	1
decidedly	1
the	1
most	1
painful	1
thought	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
contend	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
my	1
tender	1
point	1
and	1
shook	1
my	1
decision	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
things	1
else	1
besides	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
the	1
dread	1
and	1
apprehension	1
of	1
a	1
failure	1
exceeded	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
experienced	1
at	1
my	1
first	1
attempt	1
the	1
appalling	1
defeat	1
i	1
then	1
sustained	1
returned	1
to	1
torment	1
me	1
i	1
felt	1
assured	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
failed	1
in	1
this	1
attempt	1
my	1
case	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
hopeless	1
one	1
it	1
would	1
seal	1
my	1
fate	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
forever	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
with	1
any	1
thing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
severest	1
punishment	1
and	1
being	1
placed	1
beyond	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
it	1
required	1
no	1
very	1
vivid	1
imagination	1
to	1
depict	1
the	1
most	1
frightful	1
scenes	1
through	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
case	1
i	1
failed	1
the	1
wretchedness	1
of	1
slavery	1
and	1
the	1
blessedness	1
of	1
freedom	1
were	1
perpetually	1
before	1
me	1
it	1
was	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
remained	1
firm	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
resolution	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
of	1
september	1
1838	1
i	1
left	1
my	1
chains	1
and	1
succeeded	1
in	1
reaching	1
new	1
york	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
interruption	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
how	1
i	1
did	1
so	1
what	1
means	1
i	1
adopted	1
what	1
direction	1
i	1
travelled	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
mode	1
of	1
conveyance	1
i	1
must	1
leave	1
unexplained	1
for	1
the	1
reasons	1
before	1
mentioned	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
frequently	1
asked	1
how	1
i	1
felt	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
free	1
state	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
question	1
with	1
any	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
myself	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
excitement	1
i	1
ever	1
experienced	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
one	1
may	1
imagine	1
the	1
unarmed	1
mariner	1
to	1
feel	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
rescued	1
by	1
a	1
friendly	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
from	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
a	1
pirate	1
in	1
writing	1
to	1
a	1
dear	1
friend	1
immediately	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
at	1
new	1
york	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
felt	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
escaped	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
hungry	1
lions	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
however	1
very	1
soon	1
subsided	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
again	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
great	1
insecurity	1
and	1
loneliness	1
i	1
was	1
yet	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
back	1
and	1
subjected	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
slavery	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
damp	1
the	1
ardor	1
of	1
my	1
enthusiasm	1
but	1
the	1
loneliness	1
overcame	1
me	1
there	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
perfect	1
stranger	1
without	1
home	1
and	1
without	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
brethren	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
father	1
and	1
yet	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
to	1
unfold	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
my	1
sad	1
condition	1
i	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
wrong	1
one	1
and	1
thereby	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
money	1
loving	1
kidnappers	1
whose	1
business	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
panting	1
fugitive	1
as	1
the	1
ferocious	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
prey	1
the	1
motto	1
which	1
i	1
adopted	1
when	1
i	1
started	1
from	1
slavery	1
was	1
this	1
trust	1
no	1
man	1
i	1
saw	1
in	1
every	1
white	1
man	1
an	1
enemy	1
and	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
colored	1
man	1
cause	1
for	1
distrust	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
situation	1
and	1
to	1
understand	1
it	1
one	1
must	1
needs	1
experience	1
it	1
or	1
imagine	1
himself	1
in	1
similar	1
circumstances	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
a	1
fugitive	1
slave	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land	1
a	1
land	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
hunting	1
ground	1
for	1
slaveholders	1
whose	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
legalized	1
kidnappers	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
every	1
moment	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
terrible	1
liability	1
of	1
being	1
seized	1
upon	1
by	1
his	1
fellowmen	1
as	1
the	1
hideous	1
crocodile	1
seizes	1
upon	1
his	1
prey	1
i	1
say	1
let	1
him	1
place	1
himself	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
without	1
home	1
or	1
friends	1
without	1
money	1
or	1
credit	1
wanting	1
shelter	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
wanting	1
bread	1
and	1
no	1
money	1
to	1
buy	1
it	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
let	1
him	1
feel	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
pursued	1
by	1
merciless	1
men	1
hunters	1
and	1
in	1
total	1
darkness	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
or	1
where	1
to	1
stay	1
perfectly	1
helpless	1
both	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
defence	1
and	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
plenty	1
yet	1
suffering	1
the	1
terrible	1
gnawings	1
of	1
hunger	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
houses	1
yet	1
having	1
no	1
home	1
among	1
fellow	1
men	1
yet	1
feeling	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
wild	1
beasts	1
whose	1
greediness	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
trembling	1
and	1
half	1
famished	1
fugitive	1
is	1
only	1
equalled	1
by	1
that	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
monsters	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
helpless	1
fish	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
subsist	1
i	1
say	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
this	1
most	1
trying	1
situation	1
the	1
situation	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
placed	1
then	1
and	1
not	1
till	1
then	1
will	1
he	1
fully	1
appreciate	1
the	1
hardships	1
of	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
sympathize	1
with	1
the	1
toil	1
worn	1
and	1
whip	1
scarred	1
fugitive	1
slave	1
thank	1
heaven	1
i	1
remained	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
distressed	1
situation	1
i	1
was	1
relieved	1
from	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
humane	1
hand	1
of	1
mr	1
david	1
ruggles	1
whose	1
vigilance	1
kindness	1
and	1
perseverance	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
words	1
can	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
gratitude	1
i	1
bear	1
him	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
is	1
now	1
afflicted	1
with	1
blindness	1
and	1
is	1
himself	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
offices	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
once	1
so	1
forward	1
in	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
toward	1
others	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
new	1
york	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
when	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
sought	1
me	1
out	1
and	1
very	1
kindly	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
boarding	1
house	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
church	1
and	1
lespenard	1
streets	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
was	1
then	1
very	1
deeply	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
memorable	1
_darg_	1
case	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
attending	1
to	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
other	1
fugitive	1
slaves	1
devising	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
for	1
their	1
successful	1
escape	1
and	1
though	1
watched	1
and	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
almost	1
every	1
side	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
his	1
enemies	1
very	1
soon	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
me	1
where	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
he	1
deemed	1
it	1
unsafe	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
new	1
york	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
calker	1
and	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
work	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
canada	1
but	1
he	1
decided	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
my	1
going	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
thinking	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
work	1
there	1
at	1
my	1
trade	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
anna	1
my	1
intended	1
wife	1
came	1
on	1
for	1
i	1
wrote	1
to	1
her	1
immediately	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
at	1
new	1
york	1
notwithstanding	1

changed	1
my	1

from	1

to	1
that	1
of	1

upon	1
receiving	1
this	1
certificate	1
and	1
a	1
five	1
dollar	1
bill	1
from	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
i	1
shouldered	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
baggage	1
and	1
anna	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
we	1
set	1
out	1
forthwith	1
to	1
take	1
passage	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
steamboat	1
john	1
w	1
richmond	1
for	1
newport	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
mr	1
ruggles	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
a	1
mr	1
shaw	1
in	1
newport	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
case	1
my	1
money	1
did	1
not	1
serve	1
me	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
to	1
stop	1
in	1
newport	1
and	1
obtain	1
further	1
assistance	1
but	1
upon	1
our	1
arrival	1
at	1
newport	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
that	1
notwithstanding	1
we	1
lacked	1
the	1
necessary	1
money	1
to	1
pay	1
our	1
fare	1
we	1
decided	1
to	1
take	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
stage	1
and	1
promise	1
to	1
pay	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
we	1
were	1
encouraged	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
by	1
two	1
excellent	1
gentlemen	1
residents	1
of	1
new	1
bedford	1
whose	1
names	1
i	1
afterward	1
ascertained	1
to	1
be	1
joseph	1
ricketson	1
and	1
william	1
c	1
taber	1
they	1
seemed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
understand	1
our	1
circumstances	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
such	1
assurance	1
of	1
their	1
friendliness	1
as	1
put	1
us	1
fully	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
their	1
presence	1
it	1
was	1
good	1
indeed	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
such	1
friends	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
upon	1
reaching	1
new	1
bedford	1
we	1
were	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mr	1
nathan	1
johnson	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
were	1
kindly	1
received	1
and	1
hospitably	1
provided	1
for	1
both	1
mr	1
and	1
mrs	1
johnson	1
took	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
lively	1
interest	1
in	1
our	1
welfare	1
they	1
proved	1
themselves	1
quite	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
abolitionists	1
when	1
the	1
stage	1
driver	1
found	1
us	1
unable	1
to	1
pay	1
our	1
fare	1
he	1
held	1
on	1
upon	1
our	1
baggage	1
as	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
debt	1
i	1
had	1
but	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
fact	1
to	1
mr	1
johnson	1
and	1
he	1
forthwith	1
advanced	1
the	1
money	1
we	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
safety	1
and	1
to	1
prepare	1
ourselves	1
for	1
the	1
duties	1
and	1
responsibilities	1
of	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
freedom	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
our	1
arrival	1
at	1
new	1
bedford	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast	1
table	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
name	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
frederick	1
augustus	1
washington	1
bailey	1
i	1
however	1
had	1
dispensed	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
middle	1
names	1
long	1
before	1
i	1
left	1
maryland	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
generally	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
frederick	1
bailey	1
i	1
started	1
from	1
baltimore	1
bearing	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
stanley	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
new	1
york	1
i	1
again	1
changed	1
my	1
name	1
to	1
frederick	1
johnson	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
change	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
again	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
name	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
necessity	1
was	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
johnsons	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
difficult	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
them	1
i	1
gave	1
mr	1
johnson	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
choosing	1
me	1
a	1
name	1
but	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
frederick	1
i	1
must	1
hold	1
on	1
to	1
that	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
my	1
identity	1
mr	1
johnson	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
reading	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
suggested	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
douglass	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
until	1
now	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
frederick	1
douglass	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
more	1
widely	1
known	1
by	1
that	1
name	1
than	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
i	1
shall	1
continue	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
i	1
was	1
quite	1
disappointed	1
at	1
the	1
general	1
appearance	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
the	1
impression	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
received	1
respecting	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
i	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
singularly	1
erroneous	1
i	1
had	1
very	1
strangely	1
supposed	1
while	1
in	1
slavery	1
that	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
and	1
scarcely	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
luxuries	1
of	1
life	1
were	1
enjoyed	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
were	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
i	1
probably	1
came	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
northern	1
people	1
owned	1
no	1
slaves	1
i	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
upon	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
non	1
slaveholding	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
i	1
knew	1
_they_	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
poor	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
regard	1
their	1
poverty	1
as	1
the	1
necessary	1
consequence	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
non	1
slaveholders	1
i	1
had	1
somehow	1
imbibed	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
slaves	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
wealth	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
refinement	1
and	1
upon	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
i	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
a	1
rough	1
hard	1
handed	1
and	1
uncultivated	1
population	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
spartan	1
like	1
simplicity	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
ease	1
luxury	1
pomp	1
and	1
grandeur	1
of	1
southern	1
slaveholders	1
such	1
being	1
my	1
conjectures	1
any	1
one	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
new	1
bedford	1
may	1
very	1
readily	1
infer	1
how	1
palpably	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
i	1
reached	1
new	1
bedford	1
i	1
visited	1
the	1
wharves	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
shipping	1
here	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
surrounded	1
with	1
the	1
strongest	1
proofs	1
of	1
wealth	1
lying	1
at	1
the	1
wharves	1
and	1
riding	1
in	1
the	1
stream	1
i	1
saw	1
many	1
ships	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
model	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
order	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
size	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
i	1
was	1
walled	1
in	1
by	1
granite	1
warehouses	1
of	1
the	1
widest	1
dimensions	1
stowed	1
to	1
their	1
utmost	1
capacity	1
with	1
the	1
necessaries	1
and	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
added	1
to	1
this	1
almost	1
every	1
body	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
work	1
but	1
noiselessly	1
so	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
in	1
baltimore	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
loud	1
songs	1
heard	1
from	1
those	1
engaged	1
in	1
loading	1
and	1
unloading	1
ships	1
i	1
heard	1
no	1
deep	1
oaths	1
or	1
horrid	1
curses	1
on	1
the	1
laborer	1
i	1
saw	1
no	1
whipping	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
go	1
smoothly	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
appeared	1
to	1
understand	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
went	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
sober	1
yet	1
cheerful	1
earnestness	1
which	1
betokened	1
the	1
deep	1
interest	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
looked	1
exceedingly	1
strange	1
from	1
the	1
wharves	1
i	1
strolled	1
around	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
town	1
gazing	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
splendid	1
churches	1
beautiful	1
dwellings	1
and	1
finely	1
cultivated	1
gardens	1
evincing	1
an	1
amount	1
of	1
wealth	1
comfort	1
taste	1
and	1
refinement	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
slaveholding	1
maryland	1
every	1
thing	1
looked	1
clean	1
new	1
and	1
beautiful	1
i	1
saw	1
few	1
or	1
no	1
dilapidated	1
houses	1
with	1
poverty	1
stricken	1
inmates	1
no	1
half	1
naked	1
children	1
and	1
barefooted	1
women	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
see	1
in	1
hillsborough	1
easton	1
st	1
michael	1
s	1
and	1
baltimore	1
the	1
people	1
looked	1
more	1
able	1
stronger	1
healthier	1
and	1
happier	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
maryland	1
i	1
was	1
for	1
once	1
made	1
glad	1
by	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
extreme	1
wealth	1
without	1
being	1
saddened	1
by	1
seeing	1
extreme	1
poverty	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
astonishing	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
thing	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
colored	1
people	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
like	1
myself	1
had	1
escaped	1
thither	1
as	1
a	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
hunters	1
of	1
men	1
i	1
found	1
many	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
seven	1
years	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
chains	1
living	1
in	1
finer	1
houses	1
and	1
evidently	1
enjoying	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
life	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
of	1
slaveholders	1
in	1
maryland	1
i	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
my	1
friend	1
mr	1
nathan	1
johnson	1
of	1
whom	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
with	1
a	1
grateful	1
heart	1
i	1
was	1
hungry	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
meat	1
i	1
was	1
thirsty	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
drink	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
in	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
neater	1
house	1
dined	1
at	1
a	1
better	1
table	1
took	1
paid	1
for	1
and	1
read	1
more	1
newspapers	1
better	1
understood	1
the	1
moral	1
religious	1
and	1
political	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
than	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
slaveholders	1
in	1
talbot	1
county	1
maryland	1
yet	1
mr	1
johnson	1
was	1
a	1
working	1
man	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
hardened	1
by	1
toil	1
and	1
not	1
his	1
alone	1
but	1
those	1
also	1
of	1
mrs	1
johnson	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
colored	1
people	1
much	1
more	1
spirited	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
supposed	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
i	1
found	1
among	1
them	1
a	1
determination	1
to	1
protect	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
thirsty	1
kidnapper	1
at	1
all	1
hazards	1
soon	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
i	1
was	1
told	1
of	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
illustrated	1
their	1
spirit	1
a	1
colored	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
fugitive	1
slave	1
were	1
on	1
unfriendly	1
terms	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
threaten	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
informing	1
his	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
whereabouts	1
straightway	1
a	1
meeting	1
was	1
called	1
among	1
the	1
colored	1
people	1
under	1
the	1
stereotyped	1
notice	1
business	1
of	1
importance	1
the	1
betrayer	1
was	1
invited	1
to	1
attend	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
and	1
organized	1
the	1
meeting	1
by	1
appointing	1
a	1
very	1
religious	1
old	1
gentleman	1
as	1
president	1
who	1
i	1
believe	1
made	1
a	1
prayer	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
meeting	1
as	1
follows	1
_friends	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
him	1
here	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
recommend	1
that	1
you	1
young	1
men	1
just	1
take	1
him	1
outside	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
kill	1
him	1
_	1
with	1
this	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
bolted	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
intercepted	1
by	1
some	1
more	1
timid	1
than	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
betrayer	1
escaped	1
their	1
vengeance	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
since	1
i	1
believe	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
more	1
such	1
threats	1
and	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
hereafter	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
death	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
i	1
found	1
employment	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
in	1
stowing	1
a	1
sloop	1
with	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
oil	1
it	1
was	1
new	1
dirty	1
and	1
hard	1
work	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
went	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
glad	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
willing	1
hand	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
my	1
own	1
master	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
moment	1
the	1
rapture	1
of	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
understood	1
only	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
slaves	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
work	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
my	1
own	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
master	1
hugh	1
standing	1
ready	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
earned	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
worked	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
pleasure	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
experienced	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
newly	1
married	1
wife	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
starting	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
existence	1
when	1
i	1
got	1
through	1
with	1
that	1
job	1
i	1
went	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
a	1
job	1
of	1
calking	1
but	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
prejudice	1
against	1
color	1
among	1
the	1
white	1
calkers	1
that	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
employment	1
i	1
am	1
told	1
that	1
colored	1
persons	1
can	1
now	1
get	1
employment	1
at	1
calking	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
anti	1
slavery	1
effort	1
finding	1
my	1
trade	1
of	1
no	1
immediate	1
benefit	1
i	1
threw	1
off	1
my	1
calking	1
habiliments	1
and	1
prepared	1
myself	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
work	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
do	1
mr	1
johnson	1
kindly	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
his	1
wood	1
horse	1
and	1
saw	1
and	1
i	1
very	1
soon	1
found	1
myself	1
a	1
plenty	1
of	1
work	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
work	1
too	1
hard	1
none	1
too	1
dirty	1
i	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
saw	1
wood	1
shovel	1
coal	1
carry	1
wood	1
sweep	1
the	1
chimney	1
or	1
roll	1
oil	1
casks	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
for	1
nearly	1
three	1
years	1
in	1
new	1
bedford	1
before	1
i	1
became	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
anti	1
slavery	1
world	1
in	1
about	1
four	1
months	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
new	1
bedford	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
inquired	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
liberator	1
i	1
told	1
him	1
i	1
did	1
but	1
just	1
having	1
made	1
my	1
escape	1
from	1
slavery	1
i	1
remarked	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it	1
then	1
i	1
however	1
finally	1
became	1
a	1
subscriber	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
paper	1
came	1
and	1
i	1
read	1
it	1
from	1
week	1
to	1
week	1
with	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
idle	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
paper	1
became	1
my	1
meat	1
and	1
my	1
drink	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
set	1
all	1
on	1
fire	1
its	1
sympathy	1
for	1
my	1
brethren	1
in	1
bonds	1
its	1
scathing	1
denunciations	1
of	1
slaveholders	1
its	1
faithful	1
exposures	1
of	1
slavery	1
and	1
its	1
powerful	1
attacks	1
upon	1
the	1
upholders	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
sent	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
joy	1
through	1
my	1
soul	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
reader	1
of	1
the	1
liberator	1
before	1
i	1
got	1
a	1
pretty	1
correct	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
measures	1
and	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
anti	1
slavery	1
reform	1
i	1
took	1
right	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
i	1
could	1
do	1
but	1
little	1
but	1
what	1
i	1
could	1
i	1
did	1
with	1
a	1
joyful	1
heart	1
and	1
never	1
felt	1
happier	1
than	1
when	1
in	1
an	1
anti	1
slavery	1
meeting	1
i	1
seldom	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
the	1
meetings	1
because	1
what	1
i	1
wanted	1
to	1
say	1
was	1
said	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
by	1
others	1
but	1
while	1
attending	1
an	1
anti	1
slavery	1
convention	1
at	1
nantucket	1
on	1
the	1
11th	1
of	1
august	1
1841	1
i	1
felt	1
strongly	1
moved	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
much	1
urged	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
by	1
mr	1
william	1
c	1
coffin	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
me	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
colored	1
people	1
s	1
meeting	1
at	1
new	1
bedford	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
severe	1
cross	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
reluctantly	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
i	1
felt	1
myself	1
a	1
slave	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
white	1
people	1
weighed	1
me	1
down	1
i	1
spoke	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
when	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
freedom	1
and	1
said	1
what	1
i	1
desired	1
with	1
considerable	1
ease	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
until	1
now	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
engaged	1
in	1
pleading	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
brethren	1
with	1
what	1
success	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
devotion	1
i	1
leave	1
those	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
labors	1
to	1
decide	1
appendix	1
i	1
find	1
since	1
reading	1
over	1
the	1
foregoing	1
narrative	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
in	1
several	1
instances	1
spoken	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
tone	1
and	1
manner	1
respecting	1
religion	1
as	1
may	1
possibly	1
lead	1
those	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
my	1
religious	1
views	1
to	1
suppose	1
me	1
an	1
opponent	1
of	1
all	1
religion	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
liability	1
of	1
such	1
misapprehension	1
i	1
deem	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
append	1
the	1
following	1
brief	1
explanation	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
respecting	1
and	1
against	1
religion	1
i	1
mean	1
strictly	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
the	1
_slaveholding	1
religion_	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
possible	1
reference	1
to	1
christianity	1
proper	1
for	1
between	1
the	1
christianity	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
the	1
christianity	1
of	1
christ	1
i	1
recognize	1
the	1
widest	1
possible	1
difference	1
so	1
wide	1
that	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
one	1
as	1
good	1
pure	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
bad	1
corrupt	1
and	1
wicked	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
i	1
love	1
the	1
pure	1
peaceable	1
and	1
impartial	1
christianity	1
of	1
christ	1
i	1
therefore	1
hate	1
the	1
corrupt	1
slaveholding	1
women	1
whipping	1
cradle	1
plundering	1
partial	1
and	1
hypocritical	1
christianity	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
indeed	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
deceitful	1
one	1
for	1
calling	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
christianity	1
i	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
all	1
misnomers	1
the	1
boldest	1
of	1
all	1
frauds	1
and	1
the	1
grossest	1
of	1
all	1
libels	1
never	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
clearer	1
case	1
of	1
stealing	1
the	1
livery	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
i	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
unutterable	1
loathing	1
when	1
i	1
contemplate	1
the	1
religious	1
pomp	1
and	1
show	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
horrible	1
inconsistencies	1
which	1
every	1
where	1
surround	1
me	1
we	1
have	1
men	1
stealers	1
for	1

within	1
full	1
of	1
dead	1
men	1
s	1
bones	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
even	1
so	1
ye	1
also	1
outwardly	1
appear	1
righteous	1
unto	1
men	1
but	1
within	1
ye	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
iniquity	1
dark	1
and	1
terrible	1
as	1
is	1
this	1
picture	1
i	1
hold	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
strictly	1
true	1
of	1
the	1
overwhelming	1
mass	1
of	1
professed	1
christians	1
in	1
america	1
they	1
strain	1
at	1
a	1
gnat	1
and	1
swallow	1
a	1
camel	1
could	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
more	1
true	1
of	1
our	1
churches	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
proposition	1
of	1
fellowshipping	1
a	1
sheep	1
stealer	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
hug	1
to	1
their	1
communion	1
a	1
man	1
stealer	1
and	1
brand	1
me	1
with	1
being	1
an	1
infidel	1
if	1
i	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
they	1
attend	1
with	1
pharisaical	1
strictness	1
to	1
the	1
outward	1
forms	1
of	1
religion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
neglect	1
the	1
weightier	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
judgment	1
mercy	1
and	1
faith	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
but	1
seldom	1
to	1
show	1
mercy	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
represented	1
as	1
professing	1
to	1
love	1
god	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
whilst	1
they	1
hate	1
their	1
brother	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
they	1
love	1
the	1
heathen	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
they	1
can	1
pray	1
for	1
him	1
pay	1
money	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
bible	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
missionaries	1
to	1
instruct	1
him	1
while	1
they	1
despise	1
and	1
totally	1
neglect	1
the	1
heathen	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
doors	1
such	1
is	1
very	1
briefly	1
my	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
misunderstanding	1
growing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
general	1
terms	1
i	1
mean	1
by	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
deeds	1
and	1
actions	1
of	1
those	1
bodies	1
north	1
and	1
south	1
calling	1
themselves	1
christian	1
churches	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
union	1
with	1
slaveholders	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
religion	1
as	1
presented	1
by	1
these	1
bodies	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
testify	1
i	1
conclude	1
these	1
remarks	1
by	1
copying	1
the	1
following	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
communion	1
and	1
fellowship	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
which	1
i	1
soberly	1
affirm	1
is	1
true	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
without	1
caricature	1
or	1
the	1
slightest	1
exaggeration	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
drawn	1
several	1
years	1
before	1
the	1

anti	1

began	1
by	1
a	1
northern	1

piece	1
of	1
meat	1
and	1
was	1
carrying	1
it	1
home	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
peace	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
home	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
cross	1
a	1
plank	1
lying	1
across	1
a	1
running	1
brook	1
as	1
he	1
crossed	1
he	1
looked	1
down	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
shadow	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
beneath	1
thinking	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
dog	1
with	1
another	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
also	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
snap	1
at	1
the	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
fell	1
out	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
was	1
never	1
seen	1
more	1
beware	1
lest	1
you	1
lose	1
the	1
substance	1
by	1
grasping	1
at	1
the	1
shadow	1
the	1
lion	1
s	1
share	1
the	1
lion	1
went	1
once	1
a	1
hunting	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
fox	1
the	1
jackal	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
they	1
hunted	1
and	1
they	1
hunted	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
surprised	1
a	1
stag	1
and	1
soon	1
took	1
its	1
life	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
question	1
how	1
the	1
spoil	1
should	1
be	1
divided	1
quarter	1
me	1
this	1
stag	1
roared	1
the	1
lion	1
so	1
the	1
other	1
animals	1
skinned	1
it	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
four	1
parts	1
then	1
the	1
lion	1
took	1
his	1
stand	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
carcass	1
and	1
pronounced	1
judgment	1
the	1
first	1
quarter	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
capacity	1
as	1
king	1
of	1
beasts	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
mine	1
as	1
arbiter	1
another	1
share	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
chase	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
fourth	1
quarter	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
which	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
dare	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
paw	1
upon	1
it	1
humph	1
grumbled	1
the	1
fox	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
tail	1
between	1
his	1
legs	1
but	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
growl	1
you	1
may	1
share	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
share	1
the	1
spoil	1
the	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
crane	1
a	1
wolf	1
had	1
been	1
gorging	1
on	1
an	1
animal	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
when	1
suddenly	1
a	1
small	1
bone	1
in	1
the	1
meat	1
stuck	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
swallow	1
it	1
he	1
soon	1
felt	1
terrible	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
groaning	1
and	1
groaning	1
and	1
seeking	1
for	1
something	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
induce	1
every	1
one	1
he	1
met	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
bone	1
i	1
would	1
give	1
anything	1
said	1
he	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
crane	1
agreed	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
wolf	1
to	1
lie	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
open	1
his	1
jaws	1
as	1
wide	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
then	1
the	1
crane	1
put	1
its	1
long	1
neck	1
down	1
the	1
wolf	1
s	1
throat	1
and	1
with	1
its	1
beak	1
loosened	1
the	1
bone	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
got	1
it	1
out	1
will	1
you	1
kindly	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
reward	1
you	1
promised	1
said	1
the	1
crane	1
the	1
wolf	1
grinned	1
and	1
showed	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
said	1
be	1
content	1
you	1
have	1
put	1
your	1
head	1
inside	1
a	1
wolf	1
s	1
mouth	1
and	1
taken	1
it	1
out	1
again	1
in	1
safety	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
reward	1
enough	1
for	1
you	1
gratitude	1
and	1
greed	1
go	1
not	1
together	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
serpent	1
a	1
countryman	1
s	1
son	1
by	1
accident	1
trod	1
upon	1
a	1
serpent	1
s	1
tail	1
which	1
turned	1
and	1
bit	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
the	1
father	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
got	1
his	1
axe	1
and	1
pursuing	1
the	1
serpent	1
cut	1
off	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
tail	1
so	1
the	1
serpent	1
in	1
revenge	1
began	1
stinging	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
farmer	1
s	1
cattle	1
and	1
caused	1
him	1
severe	1
loss	1
well	1
the	1
farmer	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
serpent	1
and	1
brought	1
food	1
and	1
honey	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
its	1
lair	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
it	1
let	1
s	1
forget	1
and	1
forgive	1
perhaps	1
you	1
were	1
right	1
to	1
punish	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
my	1
cattle	1
but	1
surely	1
i	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
revenge	1
him	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
both	1
satisfied	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
we	1
be	1
friends	1
again	1
no	1
no	1
said	1
the	1
serpent	1
take	1
away	1
your	1
gifts	1
you	1
can	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
your	1
son	1
nor	1
i	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
my	1
tail	1
injuries	1
may	1
be	1
forgiven	1
but	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
town	1
mouse	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
mouse	1
now	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
town	1
mouse	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
went	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
cousin	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
was	1
rough	1
and	1
ready	1
this	1
cousin	1
but	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
town	1
friend	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
heartily	1
welcome	1
beans	1
and	1
bacon	1
cheese	1
and	1
bread	1
were	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
offer	1
but	1
he	1
offered	1
them	1
freely	1
the	1
town	1
mouse	1
rather	1
turned	1
up	1
his	1
long	1
nose	1
at	1
this	1
country	1
fare	1
and	1
said	1
i	1
cannot	1
understand	1
cousin	1
how	1
you	1
can	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
poor	1
food	1
as	1
this	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
cannot	1
expect	1
anything	1
better	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
come	1
you	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
to	1
live	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
a	1
week	1
you	1
will	1
wonder	1
how	1
you	1
could	1
ever	1
have	1
stood	1
a	1
country	1
life	1
no	1
sooner	1
said	1
than	1
done	1
the	1
two	1
mice	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
town	1
mouse	1
s	1
residence	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
you	1
will	1
want	1
some	1
refreshment	1
after	1
our	1
long	1
journey	1
said	1
the	1
polite	1
town	1
mouse	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
friend	1
into	1
the	1
grand	1
dining	1
room	1
there	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
feast	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
two	1
mice	1
were	1
eating	1
up	1
jellies	1
and	1
cakes	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
nice	1
suddenly	1
they	1
heard	1
growling	1
and	1
barking	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
country	1
mouse	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
dogs	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
answered	1
the	1
other	1
only	1
said	1
the	1
country	1
mouse	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
music	1
at	1
my	1
dinner	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open	1
in	1
came	1
two	1
huge	1
mastiffs	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
mice	1
had	1
to	1
scamper	1
down	1
and	1
run	1
off	1
good	1
bye	1
cousin	1
said	1
the	1
country	1
mouse	1
what	1
going	1
so	1
soon	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
yes	1
he	1
replied	1
better	1
beans	1
and	1
bacon	1
in	1
peace	1
than	1
cakes	1
and	1
ale	1
in	1
fear	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
crow	1
a	1
fox	1
once	1
saw	1
a	1
crow	1
fly	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cheese	1
in	1
its	1
beak	1
and	1
settle	1
on	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
that	1
s	1
for	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
fox	1
said	1
master	1
reynard	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
good	1
day	1
mistress	1
crow	1
he	1
cried	1
how	1
well	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
to	1
day	1
how	1
glossy	1
your	1
feathers	1
how	1
bright	1
your	1
eye	1
i	1
feel	1
sure	1
your	1
voice	1
must	1
surpass	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
birds	1
just	1
as	1
your	1
figure	1
does	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
but	1
one	1
song	1
from	1
you	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
greet	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
birds	1
the	1
crow	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
caw	1
her	1
best	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
cheese	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
snapped	1
up	1
by	1
master	1
fox	1
that	1
will	1
do	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
i	1
wanted	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
your	1
cheese	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
advice	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
do	1
not	1
trust	1
flatterers	1
the	1
sick	1
lion	1
a	1
lion	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
and	1
lay	1
sick	1
unto	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
cave	1
gasping	1
for	1
breath	1
the	1
animals	1
his	1
subjects	1
came	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
drew	1
nearer	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
helpless	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
they	1
thought	1
to	1
themselves	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
pay	1
off	1
old	1
grudges	1
so	1
the	1
boar	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
drove	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
tusks	1
then	1
a	1
bull	1
gored	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
horns	1
still	1
the	1
lion	1
lay	1
helpless	1
before	1
them	1
so	1
the	1
ass	1
feeling	1
quite	1
safe	1
from	1
danger	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
tail	1
to	1
the	1
lion	1
kicked	1
up	1
his	1
heels	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
double	1
death	1
growled	1
the	1
lion	1
only	1
cowards	1
insult	1
dying	1
majesty	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
the	1
lapdog	1
a	1
farmer	1
one	1
day	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
stables	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
his	1
beasts	1
of	1
burden	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
his	1
favourite	1
ass	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
well	1
fed	1
and	1
often	1
carried	1
his	1
master	1
with	1
the	1
farmer	1
came	1
his	1
lapdog	1
who	1
danced	1
about	1
and	1
licked	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
frisked	1
about	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
farmer	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
pocket	1
gave	1
the	1
lapdog	1
some	1
dainty	1
food	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
while	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
lapdog	1
jumped	1
into	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
lap	1
and	1
lay	1
there	1
blinking	1
while	1
the	1
farmer	1
stroked	1
his	1
ears	1
the	1
ass	1
seeing	1
this	1
broke	1
loose	1
from	1
his	1
halter	1
and	1
commenced	1
prancing	1
about	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
lapdog	1
the	1
farmer	1
could	1
not	1
hold	1
his	1
sides	1
with	1
laughter	1
so	1
the	1
ass	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
farmer	1
s	1
shoulder	1
attempted	1
to	1
climb	1
into	1
his	1
lap	1
the	1
farmer	1
s	1
servants	1
rushed	1
up	1
with	1
sticks	1
and	1
pitchforks	1
and	1
soon	1
taught	1
the	1
ass	1
that	1
clumsy	1
jesting	1
is	1
no	1
joke	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
mouse	1
once	1
when	1
a	1
lion	1
was	1
asleep	1
a	1
little	1
mouse	1
began	1
running	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
this	1
soon	1
wakened	1
the	1
lion	1
who	1
placed	1
his	1
huge	1
paw	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
big	1
jaws	1
to	1
swallow	1
him	1
pardon	1
o	1
king	1
cried	1
the	1
little	1
mouse	1
forgive	1
me	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
it	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
what	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
turn	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
so	1
tickled	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
mouse	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
paw	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
trap	1
and	1
the	1
hunters	1
who	1
desired	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
tied	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
tree	1
while	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
waggon	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
on	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
little	1
mouse	1
happened	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
sad	1
plight	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
soon	1
gnawed	1
away	1
the	1
ropes	1
that	1
bound	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
was	1
i	1
not	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
mouse	1
little	1
friends	1
may	1
prove	1
great	1
friends	1
the	1
swallow	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
birds	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
a	1
countryman	1
was	1
sowing	1
some	1
hemp	1
seeds	1
in	1
a	1
field	1
where	1
a	1
swallow	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
birds	1
were	1
hopping	1
about	1
picking	1
up	1
their	1
food	1
beware	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
quoth	1

by	1

by	1
the	1

the	1
frogs	1
desiring	1
a	1
king	1
the	1
frogs	1
were	1
living	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
marshy	1
swamp	1
that	1
just	1
suited	1
them	1
they	1
went	1
splashing	1
about	1
caring	1
for	1
nobody	1
and	1
nobody	1
troubling	1
with	1
them	1
but	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
a	1
proper	1
constitution	1
so	1
they	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
up	1
a	1
petition	1
to	1
jove	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
mighty	1
jove	1
they	1
cried	1
send	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
king	1
that	1
will	1
rule	1
over	1
us	1
and	1
keep	1
us	1
in	1
order	1
jove	1
laughed	1
at	1
their	1
croaking	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
swamp	1
a	1
huge	1
log	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
splashing	1
into	1
the	1
swamp	1
the	1
frogs	1
were	1
frightened	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
by	1
the	1
commotion	1
made	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
and	1
all	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
horrible	1
monster	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
boldest	1
of	1
them	1
ventured	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
even	1
dared	1
to	1
touch	1
it	1
still	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
then	1
the	1
greatest	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
frogs	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
log	1
and	1
commenced	1
dancing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
upon	1
it	1
thereupon	1
all	1
the	1
frogs	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
the	1
frogs	1
went	1
about	1
their	1
business	1
every	1
day	1
without	1
taking	1
the	1
slightest	1
notice	1
of	1
their	1
new	1
king	1
log	1
lying	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
them	1
so	1
they	1
sent	1
another	1
petition	1
to	1
jove	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
we	1
want	1
a	1
real	1
king	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
really	1
rule	1
over	1
us	1
now	1
this	1
made	1
jove	1
angry	1
so	1
he	1
sent	1
among	1
them	1
a	1
big	1
stork	1
that	1
soon	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
gobbling	1
them	1
all	1
up	1
then	1
the	1
frogs	1
repented	1
when	1
too	1
late	1
better	1
no	1
rule	1
than	1
cruel	1
rule	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
labour	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
countrymen	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
in	1
labour	1
smoke	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
summits	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
quaking	1
at	1
their	1
feet	1
trees	1
were	1
crashing	1
and	1
huge	1
rocks	1
were	1
tumbling	1
they	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
something	1
horrible	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
they	1
all	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
terrible	1
thing	1
this	1
could	1
be	1
they	1
waited	1
and	1
they	1
waited	1
but	1
nothing	1
came	1
at	1
last	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
violent	1
earthquake	1
and	1
a	1
huge	1
gap	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
they	1
all	1
fell	1
down	1
upon	1
their	1
knees	1
and	1
waited	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
teeny	1
tiny	1
mouse	1
poked	1
its	1
little	1
head	1
and	1
bristles	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gap	1
and	1
came	1
running	1
down	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
ever	1
after	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
much	1
outcry	1
little	1
outcome	1
the	1
hares	1
and	1
the	1
frogs	1
the	1
hares	1
were	1
so	1
persecuted	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
beasts	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
single	1
animal	1
approach	1
them	1
off	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
run	1
one	1
day	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
wild	1
horses	1
stampeding	1
about	1
and	1
in	1
quite	1
a	1
panic	1
all	1
the	1
hares	1
scuttled	1
off	1
to	1
a	1
lake	1
hard	1
by	1
determined	1
to	1
drown	1
themselves	1
rather	1
than	1
live	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
continual	1
state	1
of	1
fear	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
got	1
near	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
frogs	1
frightened	1
in	1
their	1
turn	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
hares	1
scuttled	1
off	1
and	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
truly	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hares	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
they	1
seem	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
someone	1
worse	1
off	1
than	1
yourself	1
the	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
kid	1
a	1
kid	1
was	1
perched	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
saw	1
a	1
wolf	1
passing	1
under	1
him	1
immediately	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
revile	1
and	1
attack	1
his	1
enemy	1
murderer	1
and	1
thief	1
he	1
cried	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
here	1
near	1
honest	1
folks	1
houses	1
how	1
dare	1
you	1
make	1
an	1
appearance	1
where	1
your	1
vile	1
deeds	1
are	1
known	1
curse	1
away	1
my	1
young	1
friend	1
said	1
the	1
wolf	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
brave	1
from	1
a	1
safe	1
distance	1
the	1
woodman	1
and	1
the	1
serpent	1
one	1
wintry	1
day	1
a	1
woodman	1
was	1
tramping	1
home	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
something	1
black	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
snow	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
closer	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
serpent	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
dead	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
bosom	1
to	1
warm	1
while	1
he	1
hurried	1
home	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
indoors	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
serpent	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
hearth	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
the	1
children	1
watched	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
slowly	1
come	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
then	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
stooped	1
down	1
to	1
stroke	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
serpent	1
raised	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
its	1
fangs	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sting	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
death	1
so	1
the	1
woodman	1
seized	1
his	1
axe	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
stroke	1
cut	1
the	1
serpent	1
in	1
two	1
ah	1
said	1
he	1
no	1
gratitude	1
from	1
the	1
wicked	1
the	1
bald	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
fly	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
bald	1
man	1
who	1
sat	1
down	1
after	1
work	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
summer	1
s	1
day	1
a	1
fly	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
kept	1
buzzing	1
about	1
his	1
bald	1
pate	1
and	1
stinging	1
him	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
the	1
man	1
aimed	1
a	1
blow	1
at	1
his	1
little	1
enemy	1
but	1
acks	1
palm	1
came	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
instead	1
again	1
the	1
fly	1
tormented	1
him	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
wiser	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
injure	1
yourself	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
despicable	1
enemies	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
stork	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
stork	1
were	1
on	1
visiting	1
terms	1
and	1
seemed	1
very	1
good	1
friends	1
so	1
the	1
fox	1
invited	1
the	1
stork	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
joke	1
put	1
nothing	1
before	1
her	1
but	1
some	1
soup	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
shallow	1
dish	1
this	1
the	1
fox	1
could	1
easily	1
lap	1
up	1
but	1
the	1
stork	1
could	1
only	1
wet	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
long	1
bill	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
meal	1
as	1
hungry	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
said	1
the	1
fox	1
the	1
soup	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
your	1
liking	1
pray	1
do	1
not	1
apologise	1
said	1
the	1
stork	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
return	1
this	1
visit	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
soon	1
so	1
a	1
day	1
was	1
appointed	1
when	1
the	1
fox	1
should	1
visit	1
the	1
stork	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
table	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
for	1
their	1
dinner	1
was	1
contained	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
necked	1
jar	1
with	1
a	1
narrow	1
mouth	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fox	1
could	1
not	1
insert	1
his	1
snout	1
so	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
lick	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
jar	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
apologise	1
for	1
the	1
dinner	1
said	1
the	1
stork	1
one	1
bad	1
turn	1
deserves	1
another	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
mask	1
a	1
fox	1
had	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
store	1
room	1
of	1
a	1
theatre	1
suddenly	1
he	1
observed	1
a	1
face	1
glaring	1
down	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
frightened	1
but	1
looking	1
more	1
closely	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
mask	1
such	1
as	1
actors	1
use	1
to	1
put	1
over	1
their	1
face	1
ah	1
said	1
the	1
fox	1
you	1
look	1
very	1
fine	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
any	1
brains	1
outside	1
show	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
substitute	1
for	1
inner	1
worth	1
the	1
jay	1
and	1
the	1
peacock	1
a	1
jay	1
venturing	1
into	1
a	1
yard	1
where	1
peacocks	1
used	1
to	1
walk	1
found	1
there	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
feathers	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
peacocks	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
moulting	1
he	1
tied	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
his	1
tail	1
and	1
strutted	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
peacocks	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
them	1
they	1
soon	1
discovered	1
the	1
cheat	1
and	1
striding	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
pecked	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
plucked	1
away	1
his	1
borrowed	1
plumes	1
so	1
the	1
jay	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
jays	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
his	1
behaviour	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
equally	1
annoyed	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
fine	1
feathers	1
that	1
make	1
fine	1
birds	1
the	1
frog	1
and	1
the	1
ox	1
oh	1
father	1
said	1
a	1
little	1
frog	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
one	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
pool	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
monster	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
mountain	1
with	1
horns	1
on	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
tail	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
hoofs	1
divided	1
in	1
two	1
tush	1
child	1
tush	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
frog	1
that	1
was	1
only	1
farmer	1
white	1
s	1
ox	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
so	1
big	1
either	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
taller	1
than	1
i	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
easily	1
make	1
myself	1
quite	1
as	1
broad	1
just	1
you	1
see	1
so	1
he	1
blew	1
himself	1
out	1
and	1
blew	1
himself	1
out	1
and	1
blew	1
himself	1
out	1
was	1
he	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
that	1
asked	1
he	1
oh	1
much	1
bigger	1
than	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
frog	1
again	1
the	1
old	1
one	1
blew	1
himself	1
out	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
young	1
one	1
if	1
the	1
ox	1
was	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
that	1
bigger	1
father	1
bigger	1
was	1
the	1
reply	1
so	1
the	1
frog	1
took	1
a	1
deep	1
breath	1
and	1
blew	1
and	1
blew	1
and	1
blew	1
and	1
swelled	1
and	1
swelled	1
and	1
swelled	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
m	1
sure	1
the	1
ox	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
he	1
burst	1
self	1
conceit	1
may	1
lead	1
to	1
self	1
destruction	1
androcles	1
a	1
slave	1
named	1
androcles	1
once	1
escaped	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
forest	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wandering	1
about	1
there	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
lion	1
lying	1
down	1
moaning	1
and	1
groaning	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
flee	1
but	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
lion	1
did	1
not	1
pursue	1
him	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
the	1
lion	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
paw	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
swollen	1
and	1
bleeding	1
and	1
androcles	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
huge	1
thorn	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
causing	1
all	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
thorn	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
who	1
was	1
soon	1
able	1
to	1
rise	1
and	1
lick	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
androcles	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
then	1
the	1
lion	1
took	1
androcles	1
to	1
his	1
cave	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
used	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
meat	1
from	1
which	1
to	1
live	1
but	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
both	1
androcles	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
were	1
captured	1
and	1
the	1
slave	1
was	1
sentenced	1
to	1
be	1
thrown	1
to	1
the	1
lion	1
after	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
without	1
food	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
court	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
spectacle	1
and	1
androcles	1
was	1
led	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
arena	1
soon	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
let	1
loose	1
from	1
his	1
den	1
and	1
rushed	1
bounding	1
and	1
roaring	1
towards	1
his	1
victim	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
androcles	1
he	1
recognised	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
fawned	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
licked	1
his	1
hands	1
like	1
a	1
friendly	1
dog	1
the	1
emperor	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
summoned	1
androcles	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
whereupon	1
the	1
slave	1
was	1
pardoned	1
and	1
freed	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
let	1
loose	1
to	1
his	1
native	1
forest	1
gratitude	1
is	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
noble	1
souls	1
the	1
bat	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
a	1
great	1
conflict	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
come	1
off	1
between	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
armies	1
were	1
collected	1
together	1
the	1
bat	1
hesitated	1
which	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
birds	1
that	1
passed	1
his	1
perch	1
said	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
beast	1
later	1
on	1
some	1
beasts	1
who	1
were	1
passing	1
underneath	1
him	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
bird	1
luckily	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
peace	1
was	1
made	1
and	1
no	1
battle	1
took	1
place	1
so	1
the	1
bat	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
rejoicings	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
turned	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
fly	1
away	1
he	1
then	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
but	1
soon	1
had	1
to	1
beat	1
a	1
retreat	1
or	1
else	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
torn	1
him	1
to	1
pieces	1
ah	1
said	1
the	1
bat	1
i	1
see	1
now	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
neither	1
one	1
thing	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
no	1
friends	1
the	1
hart	1
and	1
the	1
hunter	1
the	1
hart	1
was	1
once	1
drinking	1
from	1
a	1
pool	1
and	1
admiring	1
the	1
noble	1
figure	1
he	1
made	1
there	1
ah	1
said	1
he	1
where	1
can	1
you	1
see	1
such	1
noble	1
horns	1
as	1
these	1
with	1
such	1
antlers	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
had	1
legs	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
bear	1
such	1
a	1
noble	1
crown	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
slim	1
and	1
slight	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
hunter	1
approached	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
arrow	1
whistling	1
after	1
him	1
away	1
bounded	1
the	1
hart	1
and	1
soon	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
his	1
nimble	1
legs	1
was	1
nearly	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
hunter	1
but	1
not	1
noticing	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
he	1
passed	1
under	1
some	1
trees	1
with	1
branches	1
growing	1
low	1
down	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
antlers	1
were	1
caught	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
hunter	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
alas	1
alas	1
cried	1
the	1
hart	1
we	1
often	1
despise	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
useful	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
serpent	1
and	1
the	1
file	1
a	1
serpent	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
its	1
wanderings	1
came	1
into	1
an	1
armourer	1
s	1
shop	1
as	1
he	1
glided	1
over	1
the	1
floor	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
skin	1
pricked	1
by	1
a	1
file	1
lying	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
dart	1
his	1
fangs	1
into	1
it	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
heavy	1
iron	1
and	1
had	1
soon	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
his	1
wrath	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
attacking	1
the	1
insensible	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
wood	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
into	1
a	1
wood	1
one	1
day	1
with	1
an	1
axe	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
begged	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
small	1
branch	1
which	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
a	1
particular	1
purpose	1
the	1
trees	1
were	1
good	1
natured	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
branches	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
man	1
do	1
but	1
fix	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
axe	1
head	1
and	1
soon	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
cutting	1
down	1
tree	1
after	1
tree	1
then	1
the	1
trees	1
saw	1
how	1
foolish	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
giving	1
their	1
enemy	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
destroying	1
themselves	1
the	1
dog	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
a	1
gaunt	1
wolf	1
was	1
almost	1
dead	1
with	1
hunger	1
when	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
house	1
dog	1
who	1
was	1
passing	1
by	1
ah	1
cousin	1
said	1
the	1
dog	1
i	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
your	1
irregular	1
life	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
you	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
work	1
steadily	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
and	1
get	1
your	1
food	1
regularly	1
given	1
to	1
you	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
said	1
the	1
wolf	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
a	1
place	1
i	1
will	1
easily	1
arrange	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
said	1
the	1
dog	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
share	1
my	1
work	1
so	1
the	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
dog	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
town	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
there	1
the	1
wolf	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
s	1
neck	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
worn	1
away	1
so	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
about	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
said	1
the	1
dog	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
collar	1
is	1
put	1
on	1
at	1
night	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
chained	1
up	1
it	1
chafes	1
a	1
bit	1
but	1
one	1
soon	1
gets	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
said	1
the	1
wolf	1
then	1
good	1
bye	1
to	1
you	1
master	1
dog	1
better	1
starve	1
free	1
than	1
be	1
a	1
fat	1
slave	1
the	1
belly	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
one	1
fine	1
day	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
belly	1
was	1
having	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
so	1
they	1
held	1
a	1
meeting	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
discussion	1
decided	1
to	1
strike	1
work	1
till	1
the	1
belly	1
consented	1
to	1
take	1
its	1
proper	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
hands	1
refused	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
food	1
the	1
mouth	1
refused	1
to	1
receive	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
teeth	1
had	1
no	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
members	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
active	1
condition	1
the	1
hands	1
could	1
hardly	1
move	1
and	1
the	1
mouth	1
was	1
all	1
parched	1
and	1
dry	1
while	1
the	1
legs	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
rest	1
so	1
thus	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
belly	1
in	1
its	1
dull	1
quiet	1
way	1
was	1
doing	1
necessary	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
must	1
work	1
together	1
or	1
the	1
body	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
pieces	1
the	1
hart	1
in	1
the	1
ox	1
stall	1
a	1
hart	1
hotly	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
hounds	1
fled	1
for	1
refuge	1
into	1
an	1
ox	1
stall	1
and	1
buried	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
truss	1
of	1
hay	1
leaving	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
but	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
horns	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
hunters	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
any	1
one	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
hart	1
the	1
stable	1
boys	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
resting	1
after	1
their	1
dinner	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
and	1
the	1
hunters	1
went	1
away	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
the	1
master	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
saw	1
that	1
something	1
unusual	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
truss	1
of	1
hay	1
and	1
said	1
what	1
are	1
those	1
two	1
curious	1
things	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hay	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
stable	1
boys	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
they	1
discovered	1
the	1
hart	1
and	1
soon	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
thus	1
learnt	1
that	1
nothing	1
escapes	1
the	1
master	1
s	1
eye	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
grapes	1
one	1
hot	1
summer	1
s	1
day	1
a	1
fox	1
was	1
strolling	1
through	1
an	1
orchard	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes	1
just	1
ripening	1
on	1
a	1
vine	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
trained	1
over	1
a	1
lofty	1
branch	1
just	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
quench	1
my	1
thirst	1
quoth	1
he	1
drawing	1
back	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
run	1
and	1
a	1
jump	1
and	1
just	1
missed	1
the	1
bunch	1
turning	1
round	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
one	1
two	1
three	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
but	1
with	1
no	1
greater	1
success	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
tried	1
after	1
the	1
tempting	1
morsel	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
nose	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
saying	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
they	1
are	1
sour	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
despise	1
what	1
you	1
cannot	1
get	1
the	1
horse	1
hunter	1
and	1
stag	1
a	1
quarrel	1
had	1
arisen	1
between	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
the	1
stag	1
so	1
the	1
horse	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
hunter	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
help	1
to	1
take	1
revenge	1
on	1
the	1
stag	1
the	1
hunter	1
agreed	1
but	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
conquer	1
the	1
stag	1
you	1
must	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
place	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
iron	1
between	1
your	1
jaws	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
guide	1
you	1
with	1
these	1
reins	1
and	1
allow	1
this	1
saddle	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
upon	1
your	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
keep	1
steady	1
upon	1
you	1
as	1
we	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
horse	1
agreed	1
to	1
the	1
conditions	1
and	1
the	1
hunter	1
soon	1
saddled	1
and	1
bridled	1
him	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
hunter	1
the	1
horse	1
soon	1
overcame	1
the	1
stag	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
hunter	1
now	1
get	1
off	1
and	1
remove	1
those	1
things	1
from	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
back	1
not	1
so	1
fast	1
friend	1
said	1
the	1
hunter	1
i	1
have	1
now	1
got	1
you	1
under	1
bit	1
and	1
spur	1
and	1
prefer	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
present	1
if	1
you	1
allow	1
men	1
to	1
use	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
purposes	1
they	1
will	1
use	1
you	1
for	1
theirs	1
the	1
peacock	1
and	1
juno	1
a	1
peacock	1
once	1
placed	1
a	1
petition	1
before	1
juno	1
desiring	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
nightingale	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
attractions	1
but	1
juno	1
refused	1
his	1
request	1
when	1
he	1
persisted	1
and	1
pointed	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
favourite	1
bird	1
she	1
said	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
your	1
lot	1
one	1
cannot	1
be	1
first	1
in	1
everything	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
when	1
first	1
the	1
fox	1
saw	1
the	1
lion	1
he	1
was	1
terribly	1
frightened	1
and	1
ran	1
away	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
next	1
time	1
however	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
beasts	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
safe	1
distance	1
and	1
watched	1
him	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
one	1
another	1
the	1
fox	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
with	1
him	1
asking	1
him	1
how	1
his	1
family	1
were	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
again	1
then	1
turning	1
his	1
tail	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
the	1
lion	1
without	1
much	1
ceremony	1
familiarity	1
breeds	1
contempt	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
statue	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
lion	1
were	1
discussing	1
the	1
relative	1
strength	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
lions	1
in	1
general	1
the	1
man	1
contended	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
were	1
stronger	1
than	1
lions	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
their	1
greater	1
intelligence	1
come	1
now	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
soon	1
prove	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
right	1
so	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
gardens	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
a	1
statue	1
of	1
hercules	1
overcoming	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
tearing	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
two	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
said	1
the	1
lion	1
but	1
proves	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
made	1
the	1
statue	1
we	1
can	1
easily	1
represent	1
things	1
as	1
we	1
wish	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ant	1
and	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
in	1
a	1
field	1
one	1
summer	1
s	1
day	1
a	1
grasshopper	1
was	1
hopping	1
about	1
chirping	1
and	1
singing	1
to	1
its	1
heart	1
s	1
content	1
an	1
ant	1
passed	1
by	1
bearing	1
along	1
with	1
great	1
toil	1
an	1
ear	1
of	1
corn	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
to	1
the	1
nest	1
why	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
chat	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
instead	1
of	1
toiling	1
and	1
moiling	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
i	1
am	1
helping	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
said	1
the	1
ant	1
and	1
recommend	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
why	1
bother	1
about	1
winter	1
said	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
plenty	1
of	1
food	1
at	1
present	1
but	1
the	1
ant	1
went	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
and	1
continued	1
its	1
toil	1
when	1
the	1
winter	1
came	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
had	1
no	1
food	1
and	1
found	1
itself	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger	1
while	1
it	1
saw	1
the	1
ants	1
distributing	1
every	1
day	1
corn	1
and	1
grain	1
from	1
the	1
stores	1
they	1
had	1
collected	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
then	1
the	1
grasshopper	1
knew	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
necessity	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
reed	1
well	1
little	1
one	1
said	1
a	1
tree	1
to	1
a	1
reed	1
that	1
was	1
growing	1
at	1
its	1
foot	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
plant	1
your	1
feet	1
deeply	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
raise	1
your	1
head	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
am	1
contented	1
with	1
my	1
lot	1
said	1
the	1
reed	1
i	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
grand	1
but	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
am	1
safer	1
safe	1
sneered	1
the	1
tree	1
who	1
shall	1
pluck	1
me	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots	1
or	1
bow	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
but	1
it	1
soon	1
had	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
its	1
boasting	1
for	1
a	1
hurricane	1
arose	1
which	1
tore	1
it	1
up	1
from	1
its	1
roots	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
a	1
useless	1
log	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
while	1
the	1
little	1
reed	1
bending	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
soon	1
stood	1
upright	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
storm	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
obscurity	1
often	1
brings	1
safety	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
cat	1
a	1
fox	1
was	1
boasting	1
to	1
a	1
cat	1
of	1
its	1
clever	1
devices	1
for	1
escaping	1
its	1
enemies	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
whole	1
bag	1
of	1
tricks	1
he	1
said	1
which	1
contains	1
a	1
hundred	1
ways	1
of	1
escaping	1
my	1
enemies	1
i	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
said	1
the	1
cat	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
generally	1
manage	1
with	1
that	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
hounds	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
cat	1
immediately	1
scampered	1
up	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
hid	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
boughs	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
plan	1
said	1
the	1
cat	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
fox	1
thought	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
way	1
then	1
of	1
another	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
debating	1
the	1
hounds	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
fox	1
in	1
his	1
confusion	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
soon	1
killed	1
by	1
the	1
huntsmen	1
miss	1
puss	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
on	1
said	1
better	1
one	1
safe	1
way	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
cannot	1
reckon	1
the	1
wolf	1
in	1
sheep	1
s	1
clothing	1
a	1
wolf	1
found	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
getting	1
at	1
the	1
sheep	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
vigilance	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
and	1
his	1
dogs	1
but	1
one	1
day	1
it	1
found	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
a	1
sheep	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
flayed	1
and	1
thrown	1
aside	1
so	1
it	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
over	1
its	1
own	1
pelt	1
and	1
strolled	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
sheep	1
the	1
lamb	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
sheep	1
whose	1
skin	1
the	1
wolf	1
was	1
wearing	1
began	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
wolf	1
in	1
the	1
sheep	1
s	1
clothing	1
so	1
leading	1
the	1
lamb	1
a	1
little	1
apart	1
he	1
soon	1
made	1
a	1
meal	1
off	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
deceiving	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
enjoying	1
hearty	1
meals	1
appearances	1
are	1
deceptive	1
the	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
manger	1
a	1
dog	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
its	1
afternoon	1
nap	1
jumped	1
into	1
the	1
manger	1
of	1
an	1
ox	1
and	1
lay	1
there	1
cosily	1
upon	1
the	1
straw	1
but	1
soon	1
the	1
ox	1
returning	1
from	1
its	1
afternoon	1
work	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
manger	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
eat	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
straw	1
the	1
dog	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
being	1
awakened	1
from	1
its	1
slumber	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
barked	1
at	1
the	1
ox	1
and	1
whenever	1
it	1
came	1
near	1
attempted	1
to	1
bite	1
it	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
ox	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
at	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
muttering	1
ah	1
people	1
often	1
grudge	1
others	1
what	1
they	1
cannot	1
enjoy	1
themselves	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
wooden	1
god	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
men	1
used	1
to	1
worship	1
sticks	1
and	1
stones	1
and	1
idols	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
luck	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
often	1
prayed	1
to	1
a	1
wooden	1
idol	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
but	1
his	1
luck	1
never	1
seemed	1
to	1
change	1
he	1
prayed	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
remained	1
as	1
unlucky	1
as	1
ever	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
rage	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
wooden	1
god	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
blow	1
swept	1
it	1
down	1
from	1
its	1
pedestal	1
the	1
idol	1
broke	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
see	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
coins	1
flying	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
the	1
fisher	1
a	1
fisher	1
once	1
took	1
his	1
bagpipes	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
a	1
river	1
and	1
played	1
upon	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
fish	1
rise	1
but	1
never	1
a	1
one	1
put	1
his	1
nose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
so	1
he	1
cast	1
his	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
soon	1
drew	1
it	1
forth	1
filled	1
with	1
fish	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
bagpipes	1
again	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
played	1
the	1
fish	1
leapt	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
net	1
ah	1
you	1
dance	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
play	1
said	1
he	1
yes	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
fish	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
power	1
you	1
must	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
bids	1
you	1
the	1
shepherd	1
s	1
boy	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
young	1
shepherd	1
boy	1
who	1
tended	1
his	1
sheep	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
mountain	1
near	1
a	1
dark	1
forest	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
lonely	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
day	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
upon	1
a	1
plan	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
a	1
little	1
company	1
and	1
some	1
excitement	1
he	1
rushed	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
village	1
calling	1
out	1
wolf	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
villagers	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
stopped	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
this	1
pleased	1
the	1
boy	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
afterwards	1
he	1
tried	1
the	1
same	1
trick	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
villagers	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
help	1
but	1
shortly	1
after	1
this	1
a	1
wolf	1
actually	1
did	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
worry	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
of	1
course	1
cried	1
out	1
wolf	1
wolf	1
still	1
louder	1
than	1
before	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
villagers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
fooled	1
twice	1
before	1
thought	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
again	1
deceiving	1
them	1
and	1
nobody	1
stirred	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
help	1
so	1
the	1
wolf	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
meal	1
off	1
the	1
boy	1
s	1
flock	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
boy	1
complained	1
the	1
wise	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
said	1
a	1
liar	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
believed	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
the	1
truth	1
the	1
young	1
thief	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
daring	1
act	1
of	1
theft	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
condemned	1
to	1
be	1
executed	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
expressed	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
her	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
execution	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
this	1
was	1
granted	1
when	1
his	1
mother	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
want	1
to	1
whisper	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
brought	1
her	1
ear	1
near	1
him	1
he	1
nearly	1
bit	1
it	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
bystanders	1
were	1
horrified	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
mean	1
by	1
such	1
brutal	1
and	1
inhuman	1
conduct	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
punish	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
young	1
i	1
began	1
with	1
stealing	1
little	1
things	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
home	1
to	1
mother	1
instead	1
of	1
rebuking	1
and	1
punishing	1
me	1
she	1
laughed	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
noticed	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
here	1
to	1
day	1
he	1
is	1
right	1
woman	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
lord	1
hath	1
said	1
train	1
up	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
old	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
depart	1
therefrom	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
wives	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
when	1
men	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
wives	1
a	1
middle	1
aged	1
man	1
had	1
one	1
wife	1
that	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
young	1
each	1
loved	1
him	1
very	1
much	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
like	1
herself	1
now	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
hair	1
was	1
turning	1
grey	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
too	1
old	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
every	1
night	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
comb	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
pick	1
out	1
the	1
white	1
ones	1
but	1
the	1
elder	1
wife	1
saw	1
her	1
husband	1
growing	1
grey	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
so	1
every	1
morning	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
arrange	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
pick	1
out	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
ones	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
the	1
consequence	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
soon	1
found	1
himself	1
entirely	1
bald	1
yield	1
to	1
all	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
yield	1
the	1
nurse	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
be	1
quiet	1
now	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
nurse	1
to	1
a	1
child	1
sitting	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
if	1
you	1
make	1
that	1
noise	1
again	1
i	1
will	1
throw	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
wolf	1
now	1
it	1
chanced	1
that	1
a	1
wolf	1
was	1
passing	1
close	1
under	1
the	1
window	1
as	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
so	1
he	1
crouched	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
waited	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
day	1
thought	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
cry	1
soon	1
and	1
a	1
daintier	1
morsel	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
had	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
day	1
so	1
he	1
waited	1
and	1
he	1
waited	1
and	1
he	1
waited	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
child	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
came	1
forward	1
before	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
nurse	1
wagging	1
his	1
tail	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
nurse	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
shut	1
down	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
the	1
dogs	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
came	1
rushing	1
out	1
ah	1
said	1
the	1
wolf	1
as	1
he	1
galloped	1
away	1
enemies	1
promises	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
the	1
tortoise	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
a	1
tortoise	1
desired	1
to	1
change	1
its	1

he	1
asked	1
an	1
eagle	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
new	1
home	1
promising	1
her	1
a	1
rich	1
reward	1
for	1
her	1
trouble	1
the	1
eagle	1
agreed	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
tortoise	1
by	1
the	1
shell	1
with	1
her	1
talons	1
soared	1
aloft	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
they	1
met	1
a	1
crow	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
eagle	1
tortoise	1
is	1
good	1
eating	1
the	1
shell	1
is	1
too	1
hard	1
said	1
the	1
eagle	1
in	1
reply	1
the	1
rocks	1
will	1
soon	1
crack	1
the	1
shell	1
was	1
the	1
crow	1
s	1
answer	1
and	1
the	1
eagle	1
taking	1
the	1
hint	1
let	1
fall	1
the	1
tortoise	1
on	1
a	1
sharp	1
rock	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
birds	1
made	1
a	1
hearty	1
meal	1
of	1
the	1

child	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
you	1
are	1
walking	1
very	1
ungracefully	1
you	1

once	1
found	1
a	1

skin	1
which	1
the	1
hunters	1
had	1
left	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
dry	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
his	1
native	1
village	1
all	1
fled	1
at	1
his	1
approach	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
animals	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
proud	1
ass	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
his	1
delight	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
brayed	1
but	1
then	1
every	1
one	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
owner	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sound	1
cudgelling	1
for	1
the	1
fright	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
a	1
fox	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
ah	1
i	1
knew	1

when	1
a	1
bear	1
rushed	1
out	1
upon	1
them	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
travellers	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
he	1
seized	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
leaves	1
the	1
other	1
seeing	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it	1
threw	1
himself	1
flat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1

with	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1

the	1

coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
put	1
his	1

close	1
to	1
his	1

and	1
sniffed	1
and	1
sniffed	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
growl	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
slouched	1
off	1
for	1
bears	1
will	1
not	1
touch	1
dead	1

then	1
the	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1

came	1
down	1
to	1
his	1

laughing	1
said	1
what	1
was	1

that	1
master	1
bruin	1
whispered	1
to	1
you	1

the	1

rose	1
they	1
both	1
floated	1
off	1
down	1
the	1

now	1
the	1

tried	1
its	1

to	1

about	1
a	1
field	1
in	1
which	1
four	1
oxen	1
used	1
to	1

many	1
a	1
time	1
he	1

whenever	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
they	1
turned	1
their	1
tails	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
so	1
that	1
whichever	1
way	1
he	1
approached	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
the	1

of	1

at	1

however	1
they	1
fell	1
a	1

went	1
off	1
to	1
pasture	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
separate	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
then	1
the	1

attacked	1
them	1
one	1
by	1

soon	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
four	1
united	1

i	1
may	1
not	1

you	1
hereafter	1
a	1
little	1

more	1

a	1

in	1
prospect	1
avaricious	1
and	1
envious	1
two	1
neighbours	1
came	1
before	1
jupiter	1
and	1
prayed	1
him	1
to	1
grant	1
their	1
hearts	1
desire	1
now	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
avarice	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
eaten	1
up	1
with	1
envy	1
so	1
to	1
punish	1
them	1
both	1
jupiter	1
granted	1
that	1
each	1
might	1
have	1
whatever	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
himself	1
but	1
only	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
had	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
the	1
avaricious	1
man	1
prayed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
room	1
full	1
of	1
gold	1
no	1
sooner	1
said	1
than	1
done	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
joy	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
grief	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
had	1
two	1
rooms	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
metal	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
envious	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
had	1
any	1
joy	1
at	1
all	1
so	1
he	1
prayed	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
put	1
out	1
by	1
which	1
means	1
his	1
companion	1
would	1
become	1
totally	1
blind	1
vices	1
are	1
their	1
own	1
punishment	1
the	1
crow	1
and	1
the	1
pitcher	1
a	1
crow	1
half	1
dead	1
with	1
thirst	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
pitcher	1
which	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
full	1
of	1
water	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
crow	1
put	1
its	1
beak	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
pitcher	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
only	1
very	1
little	1
water	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
reach	1
far	1
enough	1
down	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
tried	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
in	1
despair	1
then	1
a	1
thought	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
pebble	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pitcher	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
another	1
pebble	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pitcher	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
another	1
pebble	1
and	1
dropped	1
that	1
into	1
the	1
pitcher	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
another	1
pebble	1
and	1
dropped	1
that	1
into	1
the	1

then	1
he	1
took	1
another	1
pebble	1

dropped	1
that	1
into	1
the	1

then	1
he	1
took	1
another	1
pebble	1
and	1
dropped	1
that	1
into	1
the	1
pitcher	1
at	1
last	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
water	1
mount	1
up	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
after	1
casting	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
pebbles	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
quench	1
his	1
thirst	1
and	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
does	1
the	1
trick	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
satyr	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
a	1
wood	1
one	1
bitter	1
winter	1
s	1
night	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
roaming	1
about	1
a	1
satyr	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
way	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
lodging	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
guide	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
to	1
the	1
satyr	1
s	1
cell	1
the	1
man	1
raised	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
kept	1
on	1
blowing	1
at	1
them	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
said	1
the	1
satyr	1
my	1
hands	1
are	1
numb	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
my	1
breath	1
warms	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
satyr	1
s	1
home	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
satyr	1
put	1
a	1
smoking	1
dish	1
of	1
porridge	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
raised	1
his	1
spoon	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
he	1
began	1
blowing	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
that	1
for	1
said	1
the	1
satyr	1
the	1
porridge	1
is	1
too	1
hot	1
and	1
my	1
breath	1
will	1
cool	1
it	1
out	1
you	1
go	1
said	1
the	1
satyr	1
i	1
will	1
have	1
nought	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
blow	1
hot	1

with	1
the	1

the	1
goose	1
with	1
the	1
golden	1
eggs	1
one	1
day	1
a	1
countryman	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
nest	1
of	1
his	1
goose	1
found	1
there	1
an	1
egg	1
all	1
yellow	1
and	1
glittering	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
lead	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
away	1
because	1
he	1
thought	1
a	1
trick	1
had	1
been	1
played	1
upon	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
home	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
and	1
soon	1
found	1
to	1
his	1
delight	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
egg	1
of	1
pure	1
gold	1
every	1
morning	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
occurred	1
and	1
he	1
soon	1
became	1
rich	1
by	1
selling	1
his	1
eggs	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
rich	1
he	1
grew	1
greedy	1
and	1
thinking	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
once	1
all	1
the	1
gold	1
the	1
goose	1
could	1
give	1
he	1
killed	1
it	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
find	1
nothing	1

oft	1
o	1
er	1
reaches	1

and	1
the	1

a	1
labourer	1
lay	1
listening	1
to	1
a	1
nightingale	1
s	1
song	1
throughout	1
the	1
summer	1
night	1
so	1
pleased	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
night	1
he	1
set	1
a	1
trap	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
captured	1
it	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
caught	1
thee	1
he	1
cried	1
thou	1
shalt	1
always	1
sing	1
to	1
me	1
we	1
nightingales	1
never	1
sing	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
said	1
the	1
bird	1
then	1
i	1
ll	1
eat	1
thee	1
said	1
the	1
labourer	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
nightingale	1
on	1
toast	1
is	1
dainty	1
morsel	1
nay	1
kill	1
me	1
not	1
said	1
the	1
nightingale	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
free	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
thee	1
three	1
things	1
far	1
better	1
worth	1
than	1
my	1
poor	1
body	1
the	1
labourer	1
let	1
him	1
loose	1
and	1
he	1
flew	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
said	1
never	1
believe	1
a	1
captive	1
s	1
promise	1
that	1
s	1
one	1
thing	1
then	1
again	1
keep	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
and	1
third	1
piece	1
of	1
advice	1
is	1
sorrow	1
not	1
over	1
what	1
is	1
lost	1
forever	1
then	1
the	1
song	1
bird	1
flew	1
away	1
the	1
fox	1
the	1
cock	1
and	1
the	1
dog	1
one	1
moonlight	1
night	1
a	1
fox	1
was	1
prowling	1
about	1
a	1
farmer	1
s	1
hen	1

and	1
saw	1
a	1
cock	1
roosting	1
high	1
up	1
beyond	1
his	1
reach	1
good	1
news	1
good	1
news	1
he	1
cried	1
why	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
cock	1
king	1
lion	1
has	1
declared	1
a	1
universal	1
truce	1
no	1

hurt	1
a	1

henceforth	1

all	1
shall	1
dwell	1
together	1
in	1
brotherly	1

why	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
news	1
said	1
the	1

and	1
there	1
i	1
see	1
some	1
one	1
coming	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
can	1
share	1
the	1
good	1
tidings	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
craned	1
his	1
neck	1
forward	1
and	1
looked	1
afar	1
off	1
what	1

is	1
only	1
my	1
master	1
s	1
dog	1
that	1
is	1
coming	1
towards	1
us	1
what	1
going	1
so	1
soon	1
he	1
continued	1
as	1
the	1
fox	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
news	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
stop	1
and	1
congratulate	1
the	1
dog	1
on	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
universal	1
peace	1
i	1
would	1
gladly	1
do	1
so	1
said	1
the	1
fox	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
king	1
lion	1
s	1
decree	1
cunning	1
often	1
outwits	1
itself	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
disputing	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
stronger	1
suddenly	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
traveller	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
said	1
i	1
see	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
decide	1
our	1
dispute	1
whichever	1
of	1
us	1
can	1
cause	1
that	1
traveller	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
shall	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
stronger	1
you	1
begin	1
so	1
the	1
sun	1
retired	1
behind	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
began	1
to	1
blow	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
it	1
could	1
upon	1
the	1
traveller	1
but	1
the	1
harder	1
he	1
blew	1
the	1
more	1
closely	1
did	1
the	1
traveller	1
wrap	1
his	1
cloak	1
round	1
him	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
in	1
despair	1
then	1
the	1
sun	1
came	1
out	1
and	1
shone	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
upon	1
the	1
traveller	1
who	1
soon	1
found	1
it	1
too	1
hot	1
to	1
walk	1
with	1
his	1
cloak	1
on	1
kindness	1
effects	1
more	1
than	1
severity	1
hercules	1
and	1
the	1
waggoner	1
a	1
waggoner	1
was	1
once	1
driving	1
a	1
heavy	1
load	1
along	1
a	1
very	1
muddy	1
way	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
the	1
wheels	1
sank	1
half	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
mire	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
horses	1
pulled	1
the	1
deeper	1
sank	1
the	1
wheels	1
so	1
the	1
waggoner	1
threw	1
down	1
his	1
whip	1
and	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
hercules	1
the	1
strong	1
o	1
hercules	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
my	1
hour	1
of	1
distress	1
quoth	1
he	1
but	1
hercules	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
tut	1
man	1
don	1
t	1
sprawl	1
there	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
shoulder	1
to	1
the	1
wheel	1
the	1
gods	1
help	1
them	1
that	1
help	1
themselves	1
the	1
man	1
the	1
boy	1
and	1
the	1
donkey	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
once	1
going	1
with	1
their	1
donkey	1
to	1
market	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
along	1
by	1
its	1
side	1
a	1
countryman	1
passed	1
them	1
and	1
said	1
you	1
fools	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
donkey	1
for	1
but	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
so	1
the	1
man	1
put	1
the	1
boy	1
on	1
the	1
donkey	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
but	1
soon	1
they	1
passed	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
men	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
said	1
see	1
that	1
lazy	1
youngster	1
he	1
lets	1
his	1
father	1
walk	1
while	1
he	1
rides	1
so	1
the	1
man	1
ordered	1
his	1
boy	1
to	1
get	1
off	1
and	1
got	1
on	1
himself	1
but	1
they	1
hadn	1
t	1
gone	1
far	1
when	1
they	1
passed	1
two	1
women	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
shame	1
on	1
that	1
lazy	1
lout	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
poor	1
little	1
son	1
trudge	1
along	1
well	1
the	1
man	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
boy	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
donkey	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
the	1
passers	1
by	1
began	1
to	1
jeer	1
and	1
point	1
at	1
them	1
the	1
man	1
stopped	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
scoffing	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself	1
for	1
overloading	1
that	1
poor	1
donkey	1
of	1
yours	1
and	1
your	1
hulking	1
son	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
boy	1
got	1
off	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
they	1
thought	1
and	1
they	1
thought	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
pole	1
tied	1
the	1
donkey	1
s	1
feet	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
raised	1
the	1
pole	1
and	1
the	1
donkey	1
to	1
their	1
shoulders	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
amid	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
met	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
market	1
bridge	1
when	1
the	1
donkey	1
getting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
loose	1
kicked	1
out	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
boy	1
to	1
drop	1
his	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
pole	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
the	1
donkey	1
fell	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
his	1
fore	1
feet	1
being	1
tied	1
together	1
he	1
was	1
drowned	1
that	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
followed	1
them	1
please	1
all	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
please	1
none	1
the	1
miser	1
and	1
his	1
gold	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
miser	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
gold	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
his	1
garden	1
but	1
every	1
week	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dig	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
gloat	1
over	1
his	1
gains	1
a	1
robber	1
who	1
had	1
noticed	1
this	1
went	1
and	1
dug	1
up	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
decamped	1
with	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
miser	1
next	1
came	1
to	1
gloat	1
over	1
his	1
treasures	1
he	1
found	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
empty	1
hole	1
he	1
tore	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
raised	1
such	1
an	1
outcry	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
neighbours	1
came	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
his	1
gold	1
did	1
you	1
ever	1
take	1
any	1
of	1
it	1
out	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
nay	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
then	1
come	1
again	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hole	1
said	1
a	1
neighbour	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
good	1
wealth	1
unused	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
not	1
exist	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
mosquitoes	1
a	1
fox	1
after	1
crossing	1
a	1
river	1
got	1
its	1
tail	1
entangled	1
in	1
a	1
bush	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
mosquitoes	1
seeing	1
its	1
plight	1
settled	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
good	1
meal	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
its	1
tail	1
a	1
hedgehog	1
strolling	1
by	1
took	1
pity	1
upon	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
neighbour	1
said	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
shall	1
i	1
relieve	1
you	1
by	1
driving	1
off	1
those	1
mosquitoes	1
who	1
are	1
sucking	1
your	1
blood	1
thank	1
you	1
master	1
hedgehog	1
said	1
the	1
fox	1
but	1
i	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
why	1
how	1
is	1
that	1
asked	1
the	1
hedgehog	1
well	1
you	1
see	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
these	1
mosquitoes	1
have	1
had	1
their	1
fill	1
if	1
you	1
drive	1
these	1
away	1
others	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
fresh	1
appetite	1
and	1
bleed	1
me	1
to	1
death	1
the	1
fox	1
without	1
a	1
tail	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
a	1
fox	1
caught	1
its	1
tail	1
in	1
a	1
trap	1
and	1
in	1
struggling	1
to	1
release	1
himself	1
lost	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
stump	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
among	1
his	1
fellow	1
foxes	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
bolder	1
face	1
upon	1
his	1
misfortune	1
and	1
summoned	1
all	1
the	1
foxes	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
meeting	1
to	1
consider	1
a	1
proposal	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
place	1
before	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
assembled	1
together	1
the	1
fox	1
proposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
tails	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
how	1
inconvenient	1
a	1
tail	1
was	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
pursued	1
by	1
their	1
enemies	1
the	1
dogs	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
when	1
they	1
desired	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
hold	1
a	1
friendly	1
conversation	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
advantage	1
in	1
carrying	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
useless	1
encumbrance	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
foxes	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
recommended	1
us	1
to	1
dispense	1
with	1
our	1
chief	1
ornament	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
lose	1
it	1
yourself	1
distrust	1
interested	1
advice	1
the	1
one	1
eyed	1
doe	1
a	1
doe	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
lose	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
one	1
approaching	1
her	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
so	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
danger	1
she	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
feed	1
on	1
a	1
high	1
cliff	1
near	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
her	1
sound	1
eye	1
looking	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
whenever	1
the	1
hunters	1
approached	1
her	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
often	1
escaped	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
but	1
the	1
hunters	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye	1
and	1
hiring	1
a	1
boat	1
rowed	1
under	1
the	1
cliff	1
where	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
feed	1
and	1
shot	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
ah	1
cried	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
dying	1
voice	1
you	1
cannot	1
escape	1
your	1
fate	1
belling	1
the	1
cat	1
long	1
ago	1
the	1
mice	1
had	1
a	1
general	1
council	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
measures	1
they	1
could	1
take	1
to	1
outwit	1
their	1
common	1
enemy	1
the	1
cat	1
some	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
some	1
said	1
that	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
young	1
mouse	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
proposal	1
to	1
make	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
would	1
meet	1
the	1
case	1
you	1
will	1
all	1
agree	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
our	1
chief	1
danger	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
sly	1
and	1
treacherous	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
enemy	1
approaches	1
us	1
now	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
receive	1
some	1
signal	1
of	1
her	1
approach	1
we	1
could	1
easily	1
escape	1
from	1
her	1
i	1
venture	1
therefore	1
to	1
propose	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
bell	1
be	1
procured	1
and	1
attached	1
by	1
a	1
ribbon	1
round	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
cat	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
we	1
should	1
always	1
know	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
and	1
could	1
easily	1
retire	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
this	1
proposal	1
met	1
with	1
general	1
applause	1
until	1
an	1
old	1
mouse	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
but	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
bell	1
the	1
cat	1
the	1
mice	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
nobody	1
spoke	1
then	1
the	1
old	1
mouse	1
said	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
propose	1
impossible	1
remedies	1
the	1
hare	1
and	1
the	1
tortoise	1
the	1
hare	1
was	1
once	1
boasting	1
of	1
his	1
speed	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
animals	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
beaten	1
said	1
he	1
when	1
i	1
put	1
forth	1
my	1
full	1
speed	1
i	1
challenge	1
any	1
one	1
here	1
to	1
race	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
tortoise	1
said	1
quietly	1
i	1
accept	1
your	1
challenge	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
said	1
the	1
hare	1
i	1
could	1
dance	1
round	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
keep	1
your	1
boasting	1
till	1
you	1
ve	1
beaten	1
answered	1
the	1
tortoise	1
shall	1
we	1
race	1
so	1
a	1
course	1
was	1
fixed	1
and	1
a	1
start	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
hare	1
darted	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
at	1
once	1
but	1
soon	1
stopped	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
tortoise	1
lay	1
down	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
nap	1
the	1
tortoise	1
plodded	1
on	1
and	1
plodded	1
on	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
hare	1
awoke	1
from	1
his	1
nap	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
tortoise	1
just	1
near	1
the	1
winning	1
post	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
run	1
up	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
race	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
tortoise	1
plodding	1
wins	1
the	1
race	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
death	1
an	1
old	1
labourer	1
bent	1
double	1
with	1
age	1
and	1
toil	1
was	1
gathering	1
sticks	1
in	1
a	1
forest	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
grew	1
so	1
tired	1
and	1
hopeless	1
that	1
he	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
this	1
life	1
any	1
longer	1
ah	1
i	1
wish	1
death	1
would	1
only	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
death	1
a	1
grisly	1
skeleton	1
appeared	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
mortal	1
i	1
heard	1
thee	1
call	1
me	1
please	1
sir	1
replied	1
the	1

would	1
you	1
kindly	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
lift	1
this	1
faggot	1
of	1
sticks	1
on	1
to	1
my	1
shoulder	1
we	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
sorry	1
if	1
our	1
wishes	1
were	1
gratified	1
the	1
hare	1
with	1
many	1
friends	1
a	1
hare	1
was	1
very	1
popular	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
beasts	1
who	1
all	1
claimed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
friends	1
but	1
one	1
day	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
hounds	1
approaching	1
and	1
hoped	1
to	1
escape	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
her	1
many	1
friends	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
carry	1
her	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hounds	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
but	1
he	1
declined	1
stating	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
important	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
other	1
friends	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
assistance	1
she	1
then	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
bull	1
and	1
hoped	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
repel	1
the	1
hounds	1
with	1
his	1
horns	1
the	1
bull	1
replied	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
but	1
i	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
our	1
friend	1
the	1
goat	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
goat	1
however	1
feared	1
that	1
his	1
back	1
might	1
do	1
her	1
some	1
harm	1
if	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
ram	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
was	1
the	1
proper	1
friend	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
case	1
the	1
ram	1
replied	1
another	1
time	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
interfere	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
as	1
hounds	1
have	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
eat	1
sheep	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
hares	1
the	1
hare	1
then	1
applied	1
as	1
a	1
last	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
calf	1
who	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
responsibility	1
upon	1
himself	1
as	1
so	1
many	1
older	1
persons	1
than	1
himself	1
had	1
declined	1
the	1
task	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
hounds	1
were	1
quite	1
near	1
and	1
the	1
hare	1
took	1
to	1
her	1
heels	1
and	1
luckily	1
escaped	1
he	1
that	1
has	1
many	1
friends	1
has	1
no	1

the	1
lion	1
in	1
love	1
a	1
lion	1
once	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
maiden	1
and	1
proposed	1
marriage	1
to	1
her	1
parents	1
the	1
old	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
daughter	1
to	1
the	1
lion	1
yet	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
enrage	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
beasts	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
father	1
said	1
we	1
feel	1
highly	1
honoured	1
by	1
your	1
majesty	1
s	1
proposal	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
our	1
daughter	1
is	1
a	1
tender	1
young	1
thing	1
and	1
we	1
fear	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
vehemence	1
of	1
your	1
affection	1
you	1
might	1
possibly	1
do	1
her	1
some	1
injury	1
might	1
i	1
venture	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
your	1
majesty	1
should	1
have	1
your	1
claws	1
removed	1
and	1
your	1
teeth	1
extracted	1
then	1
we	1
would	1
gladly	1
consider	1
your	1
proposal	1
again	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
claws	1
trimmed	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
teeth	1
taken	1
out	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
they	1
simply	1
laughed	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
do	1
his	1
worst	1
love	1
can	1
tame	1
the	1
wildest	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
summoned	1
his	1
sons	1
around	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
some	1
parting	1
advice	1
he	1
ordered	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
a	1
faggot	1
of	1
sticks	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
eldest	1
son	1
break	1
it	1
the	1
son	1
strained	1
and	1
strained	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
efforts	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
bundle	1
the	1
other	1
sons	1
also	1
tried	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
successful	1
untie	1
the	1
faggots	1
said	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
stick	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
now	1
break	1
and	1
each	1
stick	1
was	1
easily	1
broken	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
meaning	1
said	1
their	1
father	1
union	1
gives	1
strength	1
the	1
lion	1
the	1
fox	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
the	1
lion	1
once	1
gave	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
unto	1
death	1
and	1
summoned	1
the	1
animals	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
hear	1
his	1
last	1
will	1
and	1
testament	1
so	1
the	1
goat	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
lion	1
s	1
cave	1
and	1
stopped	1
there	1
listening	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
then	1
a	1
sheep	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
calf	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
last	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
but	1
soon	1
the	1
lion	1
seemed	1
to	1
recover	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
cave	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
fox	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
waiting	1
outside	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
pay	1
your	1
respects	1
to	1
me	1
said	1
the	1
lion	1
to	1
the	1
fox	1
i	1
beg	1
your	1
majesty	1
s	1
pardon	1
said	1
the	1
fox	1
but	1
i	1
noticed	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
have	1
already	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
while	1
i	1
see	1
many	1
hoof	1
marks	1
going	1
in	1
i	1
see	1
none	1
coming	1
out	1
till	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
have	1
entered	1
your	1
cave	1
come	1
out	1
again	1
i	1
prefer	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
enemy	1

toils	1
than	1
out	1
again	1
the	1
ass	1
s	1
brains	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
went	1
hunting	1
together	1
the	1
lion	1
on	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
the	1
fox	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
the	1
ass	1
proposing	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
alliance	1
between	1
their	1
two	1
families	1
the	1
ass	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
meeting	1
overjoyed	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
royal	1
alliance	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
there	1
the	1
lion	1
simply	1
pounced	1
on	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
fox	1
here	1
is	1
our	1
dinner	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
watch	1
you	1
here	1
while	1
i	1

a	1
nap	1
woe	1
betide	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
touch	1
my	1
prey	1
the	1
lion	1
went	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
fox	1
waited	1
but	1
finding	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
ventured	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
ate	1
them	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
lion	1
came	1
back	1
he	1
soon	1
noticed	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
brains	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
fox	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
voice	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
brains	1

through	1
the	1

when	1
suddenly	1
it	1
heard	1
the	1
whizz	1
of	1
an	1
arrow	1
and	1
felt	1
itself	1
wounded	1
to	1
death	1
slowly	1
it	1
fluttered	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
its	1
life	1

pouring	1
out	1

looking	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1

with	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pierced	1

on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1

about	1
to	1

to	1

only	1
blow	1
this	1

a	1
buffoon	1

made	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
laugh	1
by	1
imitating	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
various	1
animals	1
he	1
finished	1
off	1
by	1
squeaking	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
pig	1
that	1
the	1
spectators	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
porker	1
concealed	1
about	1
him	1

a	1
countryman	1

next	1
day	1
sure	1
enough	1
the	1
countryman	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
down	1
squealed	1
so	1
hideously	1
that	1
the	1
spectators	1
hissed	1
and	1
threw	1
stones	1
at	1
him	1

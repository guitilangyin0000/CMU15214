to	1
mrs	1
saville	1
england	1
you	1
will	1
rejoice	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
no	1
disaster	1
has	1
accompanied	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
an	1
enterprise	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
regarded	1
with	1
such	1
evil	1
forebodings	1
i	1
arrived	1
here	1
yesterday	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
task	1
is	1
to	1
assure	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
of	1
my	1
welfare	1
and	1
increasing	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
my	1
undertaking	1
i	1
am	1
already	1
far	1
north	1
of	1
london	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
petersburgh	1
i	1
feel	1
a	1
cold	1
northern	1
breeze	1
play	1
upon	1
my	1
cheeks	1
which	1
braces	1
my	1
nerves	1
and	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
delight	1
do	1
you	1
understand	1
this	1
feeling	1
this	1
breeze	1
which	1
has	1
travelled	1
from	1
the	1
regions	1
towards	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
advancing	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
foretaste	1
of	1
those	1
icy	1
climes	1
inspirited	1
by	1
this	1
wind	1
of	1
promise	1
my	1
daydreams	1
become	1
more	1
fervent	1
and	1
vivid	1
i	1
try	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
pole	1
is	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
frost	1
and	1
desolation	1
it	1
ever	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
imagination	1
as	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
delight	1
there	1
margaret	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
forever	1
visible	1
its	1
broad	1
disk	1
just	1
skirting	1
the	1
horizon	1
and	1
diffusing	1
a	1
perpetual	1
splendour	1
there	1
for	1
with	1
your	1
leave	1
my	1
sister	1
i	1
will	1
put	1
some	1
trust	1
in	1
preceding	1
navigators	1
there	1
snow	1
and	1
frost	1
are	1
banished	1
and	1
sailing	1
over	1
a	1
calm	1
sea	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
wafted	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
surpassing	1
in	1
wonders	1
and	1
in	1
beauty	1
every	1
region	1
hitherto	1
discovered	1
on	1
the	1
habitable	1
globe	1
its	1
productions	1
and	1
features	1
may	1
be	1
without	1
example	1
as	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
undoubtedly	1
are	1
in	1
those	1
undiscovered	1
solitudes	1
what	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
of	1
eternal	1
light	1
i	1
may	1
there	1
discover	1
the	1
wondrous	1
power	1
which	1
attracts	1
the	1
needle	1
and	1
may	1
regulate	1
a	1
thousand	1
celestial	1
observations	1
that	1
require	1
only	1
this	1
voyage	1
to	1
render	1
their	1
seeming	1
eccentricities	1
consistent	1
forever	1
i	1
shall	1
satiate	1
my	1
ardent	1
curiosity	1
with	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
never	1
before	1
visited	1
and	1
may	1
tread	1
a	1
land	1
never	1
before	1
imprinted	1
by	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
man	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
enticements	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
sufficient	1
to	1
conquer	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
danger	1
or	1
death	1
and	1
to	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
commence	1
this	1
laborious	1
voyage	1
with	1
the	1
joy	1
a	1
child	1
feels	1
when	1
he	1
embarks	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
with	1
his	1
holiday	1
mates	1
on	1
an	1
expedition	1
of	1
discovery	1
up	1
his	1
native	1
river	1
but	1
supposing	1
all	1
these	1
conjectures	1
to	1
be	1
false	1
you	1
cannot	1
contest	1
the	1
inestimable	1
benefit	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
confer	1
on	1
all	1
mankind	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
generation	1
by	1
discovering	1
a	1
passage	1
near	1
the	1
pole	1
to	1
those	1
countries	1
to	1
reach	1
which	1
at	1
present	1
so	1
many	1
months	1
are	1
requisite	1
or	1
by	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
magnet	1
which	1
if	1
at	1
all	1
possible	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
an	1
undertaking	1
such	1
as	1
mine	1
these	1
reflections	1
have	1
dispelled	1
the	1
agitation	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
began	1
my	1
letter	1
and	1
i	1
feel	1
my	1
heart	1
glow	1
with	1
an	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
elevates	1
me	1
to	1
heaven	1
for	1
nothing	1
contributes	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
tranquillize	1
the	1
mind	1
as	1
a	1
steady	1
purpose	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
soul	1
may	1
fix	1
its	1
intellectual	1
eye	1
this	1
expedition	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
dream	1
of	1
my	1
early	1
years	1
i	1
have	1
read	1
with	1
ardour	1
the	1
accounts	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
voyages	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
arriving	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
pacific	1
ocean	1
through	1
the	1
seas	1
which	1
surround	1
the	1
pole	1
you	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
voyages	1
made	1
for	1
purposes	1
of	1
discovery	1
composed	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
uncle	1
thomas	1
library	1
my	1
education	1
was	1
neglected	1
yet	1
i	1
was	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
reading	1
these	1
volumes	1
were	1
my	1
study	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
and	1
my	1
familiarity	1
with	1
them	1
increased	1
that	1
regret	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
felt	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
dying	1
injunction	1
had	1
forbidden	1
my	1
uncle	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
embark	1
in	1
a	1
seafaring	1
life	1
these	1
visions	1
faded	1
when	1
i	1
perused	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
those	1
poets	1
whose	1
effusions	1
entranced	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
heaven	1
i	1
also	1
became	1
a	1
poet	1
and	1
for	1
one	1
year	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
paradise	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
creation	1
i	1
imagined	1
that	1
i	1
also	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
niche	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
where	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
homer	1
and	1
shakespeare	1
are	1
consecrated	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
failure	1
and	1
how	1
heavily	1
i	1
bore	1
the	1
disappointment	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
i	1
inherited	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
my	1
cousin	1
and	1
my	1
thoughts	1
were	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
their	1
earlier	1
bent	1
six	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
i	1
resolved	1
on	1
my	1
present	1
undertaking	1
i	1
can	1
even	1
now	1
remember	1
the	1
hour	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
dedicated	1
myself	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
enterprise	1
i	1
commenced	1
by	1
inuring	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
hardship	1
i	1
accompanied	1
the	1
whale	1
fishers	1
on	1
several	1
expeditions	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
sea	1
i	1
voluntarily	1
endured	1
cold	1
famine	1
thirst	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
sleep	1
i	1
often	1
worked	1
harder	1
than	1
the	1
common	1
sailors	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
devoted	1
my	1
nights	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
mathematics	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
medicine	1
and	1
those	1
branches	1
of	1
physical	1
science	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
naval	1
adventurer	1
might	1
derive	1
the	1
greatest	1
practical	1
advantage	1
twice	1
i	1
actually	1
hired	1
myself	1
as	1
an	1
under	1
mate	1
in	1
a	1
greenland	1
whaler	1
and	1
acquitted	1
myself	1
to	1
admiration	1
i	1
must	1
own	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
proud	1
when	1
my	1
captain	1
offered	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
dignity	1
in	1
the	1
vessel	1
and	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
earnestness	1
so	1
valuable	1
did	1
he	1
consider	1
my	1
services	1
and	1
now	1
dear	1
margaret	1
do	1
i	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
accomplish	1
some	1
great	1
purpose	1
my	1
life	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
ease	1
and	1
luxury	1
but	1
i	1
preferred	1
glory	1
to	1
every	1
enticement	1
that	1
wealth	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
path	1
oh	1
that	1
some	1
encouraging	1
voice	1
would	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
my	1
courage	1
and	1
my	1
resolution	1
is	1
firm	1
but	1
my	1
hopes	1
fluctuate	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
are	1
often	1
depressed	1
i	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
proceed	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
difficult	1
voyage	1
the	1
emergencies	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
demand	1
all	1
my	1
fortitude	1
i	1
am	1
required	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
others	1
but	1
sometimes	1
to	1
sustain	1
my	1
own	1
when	1
theirs	1
are	1
failing	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
favourable	1
period	1
for	1
travelling	1
in	1
russia	1
they	1
fly	1
quickly	1
over	1
the	1
snow	1
in	1
their	1
sledges	1
the	1
motion	1
is	1
pleasant	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
far	1
more	1
agreeable	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
english	1
stagecoach	1
the	1
cold	1
is	1
not	1
excessive	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
wrapped	1
in	1
furs	1
a	1
dress	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
adopted	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
walking	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
remaining	1
seated	1
motionless	1
for	1
hours	1
when	1
no	1
exercise	1
prevents	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
actually	1
freezing	1
in	1
your	1
veins	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
ambition	1
to	1
lose	1
my	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
post	1
road	1
between	1
st	1
petersburgh	1
and	1
archangel	1
i	1
shall	1
depart	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
town	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight	1
or	1
three	1
weeks	1
and	1
my	1
intention	1
is	1
to	1
hire	1
a	1
ship	1
there	1
which	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
paying	1
the	1
insurance	1
for	1
the	1
owner	1
and	1
to	1
engage	1
as	1
many	1
sailors	1
as	1
i	1
think	1
necessary	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
whale	1
fishing	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
sail	1
until	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
june	1
and	1
when	1
shall	1
i	1
return	1
ah	1
dear	1
sister	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
answer	1
this	1
question	1
if	1
i	1
succeed	1
many	1
many	1
months	1
perhaps	1
years	1
will	1
pass	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
meet	1
if	1
i	1
fail	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
again	1
soon	1
or	1
never	1

excellent	1

blessings	1
on	1
you	1

that	1
i	1
may	1

england	1
how	1
slowly	1
the	1
time	1
passes	1
here	1
encompassed	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
by	1
frost	1
and	1
snow	1
yet	1
a	1
second	1
step	1
is	1
taken	1
towards	1
my	1
enterprise	1
i	1
have	1
hired	1
a	1
vessel	1
and	1
am	1
occupied	1
in	1
collecting	1
my	1
sailors	1
those	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
engaged	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
on	1
whom	1
i	1
can	1
depend	1
and	1
are	1
certainly	1
possessed	1
of	1
dauntless	1
courage	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
want	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
satisfy	1
and	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
now	1
feel	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
severe	1
evil	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
friend	1
margaret	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
success	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
participate	1
my	1
joy	1
if	1
i	1
am	1
assailed	1
by	1
disappointment	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
sustain	1
me	1
in	1
dejection	1
i	1
shall	1
commit	1
my	1
thoughts	1
to	1
paper	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
medium	1
for	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
feeling	1
i	1
desire	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
sympathize	1
with	1
me	1
whose	1
eyes	1
would	1
reply	1
to	1
mine	1
you	1
may	1
deem	1
me	1
romantic	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
but	1
i	1
bitterly	1
feel	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
me	1
gentle	1
yet	1
courageous	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
cultivated	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
capacious	1
mind	1
whose	1
tastes	1
are	1
like	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
approve	1
or	1
amend	1
my	1
plans	1
how	1
would	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
repair	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
brother	1
i	1
am	1
too	1
ardent	1
in	1
execution	1
and	1
too	1
impatient	1
of	1
difficulties	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
self	1
educated	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
fourteen	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
i	1
ran	1
wild	1
on	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
read	1
nothing	1
but	1
our	1
uncle	1
thomas	1
books	1
of	1
voyages	1
at	1
that	1
age	1
i	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
celebrated	1
poets	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
country	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
derive	1
its	1
most	1
important	1
benefits	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
i	1
perceived	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
with	1
more	1
languages	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
twenty	1
eight	1
and	1
am	1
in	1
reality	1
more	1
illiterate	1
than	1
many	1
schoolboys	1
of	1
fifteen	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
thought	1
more	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
daydreams	1
are	1
more	1
extended	1
and	1
magnificent	1
but	1
they	1
want	1
as	1
the	1
painters	1
call	1
it	1
keeping	1
and	1
i	1
greatly	1
need	1
a	1
friend	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
sense	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
despise	1
me	1
as	1
romantic	1
and	1
affection	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
endeavour	1
to	1
regulate	1
my	1
mind	1
well	1
these	1
are	1
useless	1
complaints	1
i	1
shall	1
certainly	1
find	1
no	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean	1
nor	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
archangel	1
among	1
merchants	1
and	1
seamen	1
yet	1
some	1
feelings	1
unallied	1
to	1
the	1
dross	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
beat	1
even	1
in	1
these	1
rugged	1
bosoms	1
my	1
lieutenant	1
for	1
instance	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wonderful	1
courage	1
and	1
enterprise	1
he	1
is	1
madly	1
desirous	1
of	1
glory	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
word	1
my	1
phrase	1
more	1
characteristically	1
of	1
advancement	1
in	1
his	1
profession	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
englishman	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
national	1
and	1
professional	1
prejudices	1
unsoftened	1
by	1
cultivation	1
retains	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
endowments	1
of	1
humanity	1
i	1
first	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
whale	1
vessel	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unemployed	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
i	1
easily	1
engaged	1
him	1
to	1
assist	1
in	1
my	1
enterprise	1
the	1
master	1
is	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
an	1
excellent	1
disposition	1
and	1
is	1
remarkable	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
for	1
his	1
gentleness	1
and	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
his	1
discipline	1
this	1
circumstance	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
well	1
known	1
integrity	1
and	1
dauntless	1
courage	1
made	1
me	1
very	1
desirous	1
to	1
engage	1
him	1
a	1
youth	1
passed	1
in	1
solitude	1
my	1
best	1
years	1
spent	1
under	1
your	1
gentle	1
and	1
feminine	1
fosterage	1
has	1
so	1
refined	1
the	1
groundwork	1
of	1
my	1
character	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
an	1
intense	1
distaste	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
brutality	1
exercised	1
on	1
board	1
ship	1
i	1
have	1
never	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
mariner	1
equally	1
noted	1
for	1
his	1
kindliness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
obedience	1
paid	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
crew	1
i	1
felt	1
myself	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
in	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
services	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
first	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
romantic	1
manner	1
from	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
owes	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
this	1
briefly	1
is	1
his	1
story	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
he	1
loved	1
a	1
young	1
russian	1
lady	1
of	1
moderate	1
fortune	1
and	1
having	1
amassed	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
in	1
prize	1
money	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
match	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
mistress	1
once	1
before	1
the	1
destined	1
ceremony	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
bathed	1
in	1
tears	1
and	1
throwing	1
herself	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
spare	1
her	1
confessing	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
another	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
never	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
union	1
my	1
generous	1
friend	1
reassured	1
the	1
suppliant	1
and	1
on	1
being	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
instantly	1
abandoned	1
his	1
pursuit	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
bought	1
a	1
farm	1
with	1
his	1
money	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
designed	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
he	1
bestowed	1
the	1
whole	1
on	1
his	1
rival	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
prize	1
money	1
to	1
purchase	1
stock	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
solicited	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
s	1
father	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
her	1
marriage	1
with	1
her	1
lover	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
decidedly	1
refused	1
thinking	1
himself	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
father	1
inexorable	1
quitted	1
his	1
country	1
nor	1
returned	1
until	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
his	1
former	1
mistress	1
was	1
married	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
inclinations	1
what	1
a	1
noble	1
fellow	1
you	1
will	1
exclaim	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
wholly	1
uneducated	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
a	1
turk	1
and	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
ignorant	1
carelessness	1
attends	1
him	1
which	1
while	1
it	1
renders	1
his	1
conduct	1
the	1
more	1
astonishing	1
detracts	1
from	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
sympathy	1
which	1
otherwise	1
he	1
would	1
command	1
yet	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
because	1
i	1
complain	1
a	1
little	1
or	1
because	1
i	1
can	1
conceive	1
a	1
consolation	1
for	1
my	1
toils	1
which	1
i	1
may	1
never	1
know	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
wavering	1
in	1
my	1
resolutions	1
those	1
are	1
as	1
fixed	1
as	1
fate	1
and	1
my	1
voyage	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
delayed	1
until	1
the	1
weather	1
shall	1
permit	1
my	1
embarkation	1
the	1
winter	1
has	1
been	1
dreadfully	1
severe	1
but	1
the	1
spring	1
promises	1
well	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
remarkably	1
early	1
season	1
so	1
that	1
perhaps	1
i	1
may	1
sail	1
sooner	1
than	1
i	1
expected	1
i	1
shall	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
my	1
prudence	1
and	1
considerateness	1
whenever	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
others	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
care	1
i	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
sensations	1
on	1
the	1
near	1
prospect	1
of	1
my	1
undertaking	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
trembling	1
sensation	1
half	1
pleasurable	1
and	1
half	1
fearful	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart	1
i	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
unexplored	1
regions	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
mist	1
and	1
snow	1
but	1
i	1
shall	1
kill	1
no	1
albatross	1
therefore	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
for	1
my	1
safety	1
or	1
if	1
i	1
should	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
worn	1
and	1
woeful	1
as	1
the	1
ancient	1
mariner	1
you	1
will	1
smile	1
at	1
my	1
allusion	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
disclose	1
a	1
secret	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
attributed	1
my	1
attachment	1
to	1
my	1
passionate	1
enthusiasm	1
for	1
the	1
dangerous	1
mysteries	1
of	1
ocean	1
to	1
that	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
imaginative	1
of	1
modern	1
poets	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
my	1
soul	1
which	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
i	1
am	1
practically	1
industrious	1
painstaking	1
a	1
workman	1
to	1
execute	1
with	1
perseverance	1
and	1
labour	1
but	1
besides	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
marvellous	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
marvellous	1
intertwined	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
projects	1
which	1
hurries	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
pathways	1
of	1
men	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
sea	1
and	1
unvisited	1
regions	1
i	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
explore	1
but	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dearer	1
considerations	1
shall	1
i	1
meet	1
you	1
again	1
after	1
having	1
traversed	1
immense	1
seas	1
and	1
returned	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
southern	1
cape	1
of	1
africa	1
or	1
america	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
success	1
yet	1
i	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
the	1

continue	1
for	1
the	1

on	1
its	1
homeward	1
voyage	1
from	1

more	1
fortunate	1
than	1

for	1
many	1
years	1

in	1
good	1
spirits	1
my	1
men	1
are	1
bold	1
and	1
apparently	1
firm	1
of	1
purpose	1
nor	1
do	1
the	1
floating	1
sheets	1
of	1
ice	1
that	1
continually	1
pass	1
us	1
indicating	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
towards	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
advancing	1
appear	1
to	1
dismay	1
them	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
reached	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
latitude	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
although	1
not	1
so	1
warm	1
as	1
in	1
england	1
the	1
southern	1
gales	1
which	1
blow	1
us	1
speedily	1
towards	1
those	1
shores	1
which	1
i	1
so	1
ardently	1
desire	1
to	1
attain	1
breathe	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
renovating	1
warmth	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
no	1
incidents	1

hitherto	1
befallen	1
us	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
stiff	1
gales	1
and	1
the	1
springing	1
of	1
a	1
leak	1
are	1
accidents	1
which	1
experienced	1
navigators	1
scarcely	1
remember	1
to	1
record	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
content	1

nothing	1
worse	1
happen	1
to	1
us	1
during	1
our	1

will	1
not	1
rashly	1

danger	1

will	1
be	1
cool	1

pathless	1

the	1

stars	1
themselves	1

my	1
triumph	1

not	1
still	1
proceed	1
over	1
the	1

england	1
so	1
strange	1
an	1
accident	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
i	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
recording	1
it	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
before	1
these	1
papers	1
can	1
come	1
into	1
your	1
possession	1
last	1
monday	1
july	1
31st	1
we	1
were	1
nearly	1
surrounded	1
by	1
ice	1
which	1
closed	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
scarcely	1
leaving	1
her	1
the	1
sea	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
floated	1
our	1
situation	1
was	1
somewhat	1
dangerous	1
especially	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
compassed	1
round	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
thick	1
fog	1
we	1
accordingly	1
lay	1
to	1
hoping	1
that	1
some	1
change	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
and	1
weather	1
about	1
two	1
o	1
clock	1
the	1
mist	1
cleared	1
away	1
and	1
we	1
beheld	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
vast	1
and	1
irregular	1
plains	1
of	1
ice	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
end	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
comrades	1
groaned	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
watchful	1
with	1
anxious	1
thoughts	1
when	1
a	1
strange	1
sight	1
suddenly	1
attracted	1
our	1
attention	1
and	1
diverted	1
our	1
solicitude	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
situation	1
we	1
perceived	1
a	1
low	1
carriage	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
dogs	1
pass	1
on	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
a	1
being	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
but	1
apparently	1
of	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
sledge	1
and	1
guided	1
the	1
dogs	1
we	1
watched	1
the	1
rapid	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
traveller	1
with	1
our	1
telescopes	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
lost	1
among	1
the	1
distant	1
inequalities	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
this	1
appearance	1
excited	1
our	1
unqualified	1
wonder	1
we	1
were	1
as	1
we	1
believed	1
many	1
hundred	1
miles	1
from	1
any	1
land	1
but	1
this	1
apparition	1
seemed	1
to	1
denote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
reality	1
so	1
distant	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
supposed	1
shut	1
in	1
however	1
by	1
ice	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
track	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
observed	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
about	1
two	1
hours	1
after	1
this	1
occurrence	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
ground	1
sea	1
and	1
before	1
night	1
the	1
ice	1
broke	1
and	1
freed	1
our	1
ship	1
we	1
however	1
lay	1
to	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
fearing	1
to	1
encounter	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
those	1
large	1
loose	1
masses	1
which	1
float	1
about	1
after	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
i	1
profited	1
of	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
however	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
light	1
i	1
went	1
upon	1
deck	1
and	1
found	1
all	1
the	1
sailors	1
busy	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
apparently	1
talking	1
to	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
a	1
sledge	1
like	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
which	1
had	1
drifted	1
towards	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
fragment	1
of	1
ice	1
only	1
one	1
dog	1
remained	1
alive	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
within	1
it	1
whom	1
the	1
sailors	1
were	1
persuading	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
vessel	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
traveller	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
savage	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
some	1
undiscovered	1
island	1
but	1
a	1
european	1
when	1
i	1
appeared	1
on	1
deck	1
the	1
master	1
said	1
here	1
is	1
our	1
captain	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
you	1
to	1
perish	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
on	1
perceiving	1
me	1
the	1
stranger	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
english	1
although	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
accent	1
before	1
i	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
your	1
vessel	1
said	1
he	1
will	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
inform	1
me	1
whither	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
you	1
may	1
conceive	1
my	1
astonishment	1
on	1
hearing	1
such	1
a	1
question	1
addressed	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
destruction	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
that	1
my	1
vessel	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
resource	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
exchanged	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
wealth	1
the	1
earth	1
can	1
afford	1
i	1
replied	1
however	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
discovery	1
towards	1
the	1
northern	1
pole	1
upon	1
hearing	1
this	1
he	1
appeared	1
satisfied	1
and	1
consented	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
good	1
god	1
margaret	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
thus	1
capitulated	1
for	1
his	1
safety	1
your	1
surprise	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
boundless	1
his	1
limbs	1
were	1
nearly	1
frozen	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
dreadfully	1
emaciated	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
suffering	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
so	1
wretched	1
a	1
condition	1
we	1
attempted	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
he	1
fainted	1
we	1
accordingly	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
restored	1
him	1
to	1
animation	1
by	1
rubbing	1
him	1
with	1
brandy	1
and	1
forcing	1
him	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
small	1
quantity	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
life	1
we	1
wrapped	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
blankets	1
and	1
placed	1
him	1
near	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
stove	1
by	1
slow	1
degrees	1
he	1
recovered	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
little	1
soup	1
which	1
restored	1
him	1
wonderfully	1
two	1
days	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
feared	1
that	1
his	1
sufferings	1
had	1
deprived	1
him	1
of	1
understanding	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
recovered	1
i	1
removed	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
cabin	1
and	1
attended	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
my	1
duty	1
would	1
permit	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
creature	1
his	1
eyes	1
have	1
generally	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
wildness	1
and	1
even	1
madness	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
moments	1
when	1
if	1
anyone	1
performs	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
kindness	1
towards	1
him	1
or	1
does	1
him	1
any	1
the	1
most	1
trifling	1
service	1
his	1
whole	1
countenance	1
is	1
lighted	1
up	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
a	1
beam	1
of	1
benevolence	1
and	1
sweetness	1
that	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
equalled	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
generally	1
melancholy	1
and	1
despairing	1
and	1
sometimes	1
he	1
gnashes	1
his	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
impatient	1
of	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
woes	1
that	1
oppresses	1
him	1
when	1
my	1
guest	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
recovered	1
i	1
had	1
great	1
trouble	1
to	1
keep	1
off	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
questions	1
but	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
tormented	1
by	1
their	1
idle	1
curiosity	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
mind	1
whose	1
restoration	1
evidently	1
depended	1
upon	1
entire	1
repose	1
once	1
however	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
asked	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
so	1
far	1
upon	1
the	1
ice	1
in	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
vehicle	1
his	1
countenance	1
instantly	1
assumed	1
an	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
gloom	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
seek	1
one	1
who	1
fled	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
you	1
pursued	1
travel	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
yes	1
then	1
i	1
fancy	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
we	1
picked	1
you	1
up	1
we	1
saw	1
some	1
dogs	1
drawing	1
a	1
sledge	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
across	1
the	1
ice	1
this	1
aroused	1
the	1
stranger	1
s	1
attention	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
questions	1
concerning	1
the	1
route	1
which	1
the	1
demon	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
had	1
pursued	1
soon	1
after	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
doubtless	1
excited	1
your	1
curiosity	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
these	1
good	1
people	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
too	1
considerate	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
certainly	1
it	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
very	1
impertinent	1
and	1
inhuman	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
trouble	1
you	1
with	1
any	1
inquisitiveness	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
rescued	1
me	1
from	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
perilous	1
situation	1
you	1
have	1
benevolently	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
he	1
inquired	1
if	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
had	1
destroyed	1
the	1
other	1
sledge	1
i	1
replied	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
with	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
ice	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
until	1
near	1
midnight	1
and	1
the	1
traveller	1
might	1
have	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
before	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
judge	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
a	1
new	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
animated	1
the	1
decaying	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
he	1
manifested	1
the	1
greatest	1
eagerness	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
deck	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
sledge	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
appeared	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
far	1
too	1
weak	1
to	1
sustain	1
the	1
rawness	1
of	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
i	1
have	1
promised	1
that	1
someone	1
should	1
watch	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
instant	1
notice	1
if	1
any	1
new	1
object	1
should	1
appear	1
in	1
sight	1
such	1
is	1
my	1
journal	1
of	1
what	1
relates	1
to	1
this	1
strange	1
occurrence	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
the	1
stranger	1
has	1
gradually	1
improved	1
in	1
health	1
but	1
is	1
very	1
silent	1
and	1
appears	1
uneasy	1
when	1
anyone	1
except	1
myself	1
enters	1
his	1
cabin	1
yet	1
his	1
manners	1
are	1
so	1
conciliating	1
and	1
gentle	1
that	1
the	1
sailors	1
are	1
all	1
interested	1
in	1
him	1
although	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
communication	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
i	1
begin	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
constant	1
and	1
deep	1
grief	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
compassion	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
noble	1
creature	1
in	1
his	1
better	1
days	1
being	1
even	1
now	1
in	1
wreck	1
so	1
attractive	1
and	1
amiable	1
i	1
said	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
letters	1
my	1
dear	1
margaret	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
find	1
no	1
friend	1
on	1
the	1
wide	1
ocean	1
yet	1
i	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
before	1
his	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
by	1
misery	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
as	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
shall	1
continue	1
my	1
journal	1
concerning	1
the	1
stranger	1
at	1
intervals	1
should	1
i	1
have	1
any	1
fresh	1
incidents	1
to	1
record	1
august	1
13th	1
17	1
my	1
affection	1
for	1
my	1
guest	1
increases	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
excites	1
at	1
once	1
my	1
admiration	1
and	1
my	1
pity	1
to	1
an	1
astonishing	1
degree	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
see	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
creature	1
destroyed	1
by	1
misery	1
without	1
feeling	1
the	1
most	1
poignant	1
grief	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
gentle	1
yet	1
so	1
wise	1
his	1
mind	1
is	1
so	1
cultivated	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
although	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
culled	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
art	1
yet	1
they	1
flow	1
with	1
rapidity	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
eloquence	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
much	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
illness	1
and	1
is	1
continually	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
apparently	1
watching	1
for	1
the	1
sledge	1
that	1
preceded	1
his	1
own	1
yet	1
although	1
unhappy	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
utterly	1
occupied	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
misery	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
interests	1
himself	1
deeply	1
in	1
the	1
projects	1
of	1
others	1
he	1
has	1
frequently	1
conversed	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
mine	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
communicated	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
disguise	1
he	1
entered	1
attentively	1
into	1
all	1
my	1
arguments	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
my	1
eventual	1
success	1
and	1
into	1
every	1
minute	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
i	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
easily	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
sympathy	1
which	1
he	1
evinced	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
the	1
burning	1
ardour	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fervour	1
that	1
warmed	1
me	1
how	1
gladly	1
i	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
fortune	1
my	1
existence	1
my	1
every	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
my	1
enterprise	1
one	1
man	1
s	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
were	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
price	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
which	1
i	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
dominion	1
i	1
should	1
acquire	1
and	1
transmit	1
over	1
the	1
elemental	1
foes	1
of	1
our	1
race	1
as	1
i	1
spoke	1
a	1
dark	1
gloom	1
spread	1
over	1
my	1
listener	1
s	1
countenance	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
suppress	1
his	1
emotion	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
my	1
voice	1
quivered	1
and	1
failed	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
beheld	1
tears	1
trickle	1
fast	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
fingers	1
a	1
groan	1
burst	1
from	1
his	1
heaving	1
breast	1
i	1
paused	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
broken	1
accents	1
unhappy	1
man	1
do	1
you	1
share	1
my	1
madness	1
have	1
you	1
drunk	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
intoxicating	1
draught	1
hear	1
me	1
let	1
me	1
reveal	1
my	1
tale	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
dash	1
the	1
cup	1
from	1
your	1
lips	1
such	1
words	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
strongly	1
excited	1
my	1
curiosity	1
but	1
the	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
had	1
seized	1
the	1
stranger	1
overcame	1
his	1
weakened	1
powers	1
and	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
repose	1
and	1
tranquil	1
conversation	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
restore	1
his	1
composure	1
having	1
conquered	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
his	1
feelings	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
despise	1
himself	1
for	1
being	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
passion	1
and	1
quelling	1
the	1
dark	1
tyranny	1
of	1
despair	1
he	1
led	1
me	1
again	1
to	1
converse	1
concerning	1
myself	1
personally	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
earlier	1
years	1
the	1
tale	1
was	1
quickly	1
told	1
but	1
it	1
awakened	1
various	1
trains	1
of	1
reflection	1
i	1
spoke	1
of	1
my	1
desire	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
my	1
thirst	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
sympathy	1
with	1
a	1
fellow	1
mind	1
than	1
had	1
ever	1
fallen	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
and	1
expressed	1
my	1
conviction	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
boast	1
of	1
little	1
happiness	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
enjoy	1
this	1
blessing	1
i	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
replied	1
the	1
stranger	1
we	1
are	1
unfashioned	1
creatures	1
but	1
half	1
made	1
up	1
if	1
one	1
wiser	1
better	1
dearer	1
than	1
ourselves	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
do	1
not	1
lend	1
his	1
aid	1
to	1
perfectionate	1
our	1
weak	1
and	1
faulty	1
natures	1
i	1
once	1
had	1
a	1
friend	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
of	1
human	1
creatures	1
and	1
am	1
entitled	1
therefore	1
to	1
judge	1
respecting	1
friendship	1
you	1
have	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
before	1
you	1

have	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
despair	1
but	1
i	1
i	1
have	1
lost	1
everything	1
and	1
cannot	1
begin	1
life	1
anew	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
his	1
countenance	1
became	1
expressive	1
of	1
a	1
calm	1
settled	1
grief	1
that	1
touched	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
presently	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
cabin	1
even	1
broken	1
in	1
spirit	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
no	1

than	1
he	1

the	1

and	1
every	1
sight	1
afforded	1
by	1
these	1
wonderful	1

still	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
elevating	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
earth	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
double	1
existence	1
he	1
may	1
suffer	1
misery	1
and	1
be	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
disappointments	1
yet	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
retired	1
into	1
himself	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
celestial	1
spirit	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
halo	1
around	1
him	1
within	1
whose	1
circle	1
no	1
grief	1

folly	1

will	1
you	1
smile	1
at	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
i	1
express	1
concerning	1
this	1
divine	1
wanderer	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
if	1
you	1
saw	1
him	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
tutored	1
and	1
refined	1
by	1
books	1
and	1
retirement	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
therefore	1
somewhat	1
fastidious	1
but	1
this	1
only	1
renders	1
you	1
the	1
more	1
fit	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
merits	1
of	1
this	1
wonderful	1
man	1
sometimes	1
i	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
quality	1
it	1
is	1
which	1
he	1
possesses	1
that	1
elevates	1
him	1
so	1
immeasurably	1
above	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
i	1
ever	1
knew	1
i	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
intuitive	1
discernment	1
a	1
quick	1

never	1
failing	1
power	1
of	1

a	1
penetration	1
into	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
things	1
unequalled	1
for	1
clearness	1
and	1
precision	1

to	1
this	1
a	1
facility	1
of	1

yesterday	1
the	1
stranger	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
perceive	1
captain	1
walton	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
suffered	1
great	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
misfortunes	1
i	1
had	1
determined	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
these	1
evils	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
won	1
me	1
to	1
alter	1
my	1
determination	1
you	1
seek	1
for	1
knowledge	1
and	1
wisdom	1
as	1
i	1
once	1
did	1
and	1
i	1
ardently	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
your	1
wishes	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
serpent	1
to	1
sting	1
you	1
as	1
mine	1
has	1
been	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
relation	1
of	1
my	1
disasters	1
will	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
you	1
yet	1
when	1
i	1
reflect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
pursuing	1
the	1
same	1
course	1
exposing	1
yourself	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
dangers	1
which	1
have	1
rendered	1
me	1
what	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
deduce	1
an	1
apt	1
moral	1
from	1
my	1
tale	1
one	1
that	1
may	1
direct	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
succeed	1
in	1
your	1
undertaking	1
and	1
console	1
you	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
failure	1
prepare	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
occurrences	1
which	1
are	1
usually	1
deemed	1
marvellous	1
were	1
we	1
among	1
the	1
tamer	1
scenes	1
of	1
nature	1
i	1
might	1
fear	1
to	1
encounter	1
your	1
unbelief	1
perhaps	1
your	1
ridicule	1
but	1
many	1
things	1
will	1
appear	1
possible	1
in	1
these	1
wild	1
and	1
mysterious	1
regions	1
which	1
would	1
provoke	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
those	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
ever	1
varied	1
powers	1
of	1
nature	1
nor	1
can	1
i	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
tale	1
conveys	1
in	1
its	1
series	1
internal	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
composed	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
imagine	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
the	1
offered	1
communication	1
yet	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
renew	1
his	1
grief	1
by	1
a	1
recital	1
of	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
eagerness	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
promised	1
narrative	1
partly	1
from	1
curiosity	1
and	1
partly	1
from	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
ameliorate	1
his	1
fate	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
i	1
expressed	1
these	1
feelings	1
in	1
my	1
answer	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
he	1
replied	1
for	1
your	1
sympathy	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
my	1
fate	1
is	1
nearly	1
fulfilled	1
i	1
wait	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
event	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
repose	1
in	1
peace	1
i	1
understand	1
your	1
feeling	1
continued	1
he	1
perceiving	1
that	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
my	1
friend	1
if	1
thus	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
name	1
you	1
nothing	1
can	1
alter	1
my	1
destiny	1
listen	1
to	1
my	1
history	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
perceive	1
how	1
irrevocably	1
it	1
is	1
determined	1
he	1
then	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
commence	1
his	1
narrative	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
when	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
leisure	1
this	1
promise	1
drew	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
warmest	1
thanks	1
i	1
have	1
resolved	1
every	1
night	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
imperatively	1
occupied	1
by	1
my	1
duties	1
to	1
record	1
as	1
nearly	1
as	1
possible	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
related	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
if	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
engaged	1
i	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
make	1
notes	1
this	1
manuscript	1
will	1
doubtless	1
afford	1
you	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
who	1
know	1
him	1
and	1
who	1
hear	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
lips	1
with	1
what	1
interest	1
and	1
sympathy	1
shall	1
i	1
read	1
it	1
in	1
some	1
future	1
day	1
even	1
now	1
as	1
i	1
commence	1
my	1
task	1
his	1
full	1
toned	1
voice	1
swells	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
his	1
lustrous	1
eyes	1
dwell	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
melancholy	1
sweetness	1
i	1
see	1
his	1
thin	1
hand	1
raised	1
in	1
animation	1
while	1
the	1
lineaments	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
are	1
irradiated	1
by	1
the	1
soul	1
within	1
strange	1
and	1
harrowing	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
story	1
frightful	1
the	1
storm	1
which	1
embraced	1
the	1
gallant	1
vessel	1
on	1
its	1
course	1
and	1
wrecked	1

thus	1
chapter	1
1	1
i	1
am	1
by	1
birth	1
a	1
genevese	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
of	1
that	1
republic	1
my	1
ancestors	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
counsellors	1
and	1
syndics	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
filled	1
several	1
public	1
situations	1
with	1
honour	1
and	1
reputation	1
he	1
was	1
respected	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
integrity	1
and	1
indefatigable	1
attention	1
to	1
public	1
business	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
younger	1
days	1
perpetually	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
circumstances	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
marrying	1
early	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
as	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
marriage	1
illustrate	1
his	1
character	1
i	1
cannot	1
refrain	1
from	1
relating	1
them	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
was	1
a	1
merchant	1
who	1
from	1
a	1
flourishing	1
state	1
fell	1
through	1
numerous	1
mischances	1
into	1
poverty	1
this	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
beaufort	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
proud	1
and	1
unbending	1
disposition	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
poverty	1
and	1
oblivion	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
distinguished	1
for	1
his	1
rank	1
and	1
magnificence	1
having	1
paid	1
his	1
debts	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
honourable	1
manner	1
he	1
retreated	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
lucerne	1
where	1
he	1
lived	1
unknown	1
and	1
in	1
wretchedness	1
my	1
father	1
loved	1
beaufort	1
with	1
the	1
truest	1
friendship	1
and	1
was	1
deeply	1
grieved	1
by	1
his	1
retreat	1
in	1
these	1
unfortunate	1
circumstances	1
he	1
bitterly	1
deplored	1
the	1
false	1
pride	1
which	1
led	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
a	1
conduct	1
so	1
little	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
affection	1
that	1
united	1
them	1
he	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
world	1
again	1
through	1
his	1
credit	1
and	1
assistance	1
beaufort	1
had	1
taken	1
effectual	1
measures	1
to	1
conceal	1
himself	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
months	1
before	1
my	1
father	1
discovered	1
his	1
abode	1
overjoyed	1
at	1
this	1
discovery	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
was	1
situated	1
in	1
a	1
mean	1
street	1
near	1
the	1
reuss	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
misery	1
and	1
despair	1
alone	1
welcomed	1
him	1
beaufort	1
had	1
saved	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
from	1
the	1
wreck	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
sustenance	1
for	1
some	1
months	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
procure	1
some	1
respectable	1
employment	1
in	1
a	1
merchant	1
s	1
house	1
the	1
interval	1
was	1
consequently	1
spent	1
in	1
inaction	1
his	1
grief	1
only	1
became	1
more	1
deep	1
and	1
rankling	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
reflection	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
took	1
so	1
fast	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
months	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
sickness	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
exertion	1
his	1
daughter	1
attended	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
tenderness	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
despair	1
that	1
their	1
little	1
fund	1
was	1
rapidly	1
decreasing	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
prospect	1
of	1
support	1
but	1
caroline	1
beaufort	1
possessed	1
a	1
mind	1
of	1
an	1
uncommon	1
mould	1
and	1
her	1
courage	1
rose	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
adversity	1
she	1
procured	1
plain	1
work	1
she	1
plaited	1
straw	1
and	1
by	1
various	1
means	1
contrived	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
pittance	1
scarcely	1
sufficient	1
to	1
support	1
life	1
several	1
months	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
her	1
father	1
grew	1
worse	1
her	1
time	1
was	1
more	1
entirely	1
occupied	1
in	1
attending	1
him	1
her	1
means	1
of	1
subsistence	1
decreased	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month	1
her	1
father	1
died	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
leaving	1
her	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
beggar	1
this	1
last	1
blow	1
overcame	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
knelt	1
by	1
beaufort	1
s	1
coffin	1
weeping	1
bitterly	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
he	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
protecting	1
spirit	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
who	1
committed	1
herself	1
to	1
his	1
care	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
interment	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
he	1
conducted	1
her	1
to	1
geneva	1
and	1
placed	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
a	1
relation	1
two	1
years	1
after	1
this	1
event	1
caroline	1
became	1
his	1
wife	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
ages	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
but	1
this	1
circumstance	1
seemed	1
to	1
unite	1
them	1
only	1
closer	1
in	1
bonds	1
of	1
devoted	1
affection	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
justice	1
in	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
upright	1
mind	1
which	1
rendered	1
it	1
necessary	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
approve	1
highly	1
to	1
love	1
strongly	1
perhaps	1
during	1
former	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
late	1
discovered	1
unworthiness	1
of	1
one	1
beloved	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
greater	1
value	1
on	1
tried	1
worth	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
gratitude	1
and	1
worship	1
in	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
my	1
mother	1
differing	1
wholly	1
from	1
the	1
doting	1
fondness	1
of	1
age	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
inspired	1
by	1
reverence	1
for	1
her	1
virtues	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
recompensing	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sorrows	1
she	1
had	1
endured	1
but	1
which	1
gave	1
inexpressible	1
grace	1
to	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
everything	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
her	1
wishes	1
and	1
her	1
convenience	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
shelter	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
fair	1
exotic	1
is	1
sheltered	1
by	1
the	1
gardener	1
from	1
every	1
rougher	1
wind	1
and	1
to	1
surround	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
tend	1
to	1
excite	1
pleasurable	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
soft	1
and	1
benevolent	1
mind	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
her	1
hitherto	1
constant	1
spirit	1
had	1
been	1
shaken	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
years	1
that	1
had	1
elapsed	1
previous	1
to	1
their	1
marriage	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
gradually	1
relinquished	1
all	1
his	1
public	1
functions	1

on	1

they	1
were	1

to	1

inexhaustible	1
stores	1
of	1

from	1

both	1

may	1
be	1
imagined	1
that	1
while	1
during	1
every	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
infant	1
life	1
i	1
received	1
a	1
lesson	1
of	1
patience	1
of	1
charity	1
and	1
of	1
self	1
control	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
guided	1
by	1
a	1
silken	1
cord	1
that	1
all	1
seemed	1

one	1
train	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
to	1

my	1

much	1
desired	1
to	1

i	1
continued	1

single	1
offspring	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
while	1
making	1
an	1
excursion	1
beyond	1

them	1
enter	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
poor	1
this	1
to	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
duty	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
necessity	1
a	1
passion	1
remembering	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
relieved	1

of	1
their	1
walks	1
a	1
poor	1
cot	1
in	1
the	1
foldings	1
of	1
a	1
vale	1
attracted	1
their	1
notice	1
as	1
being	1
singularly	1
disconsolate	1
while	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
half	1
clothed	1
children	1
gathered	1
about	1
it	1
spoke	1
of	1
penury	1
in	1
its	1
worst	1
shape	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
gone	1
by	1
himself	1
to	1
milan	1

accompanied	1
by	1

found	1
a	1
peasant	1

hard	1
working	1
bent	1
down	1
by	1
care	1
and	1
labour	1

a	1
scanty	1
meal	1
to	1
five	1

there	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
attracted	1
my	1

little	1

this	1
child	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
very	1
fair	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
the	1
brightest	1
living	1
gold	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
poverty	1
of	1
her	1
clothing	1
seemed	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
distinction	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
her	1
brow	1
was	1
clear	1
and	1
ample	1
her	1
blue	1
eyes	1
cloudless	1
and	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
moulding	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
so	1
expressive	1
of	1
sensibility	1
and	1
sweetness	1
that	1
none	1
could	1
behold	1
her	1
without	1
looking	1
on	1
her	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
distinct	1
species	1

my	1

fixed	1
eyes	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
admiration	1
on	1
this	1
lovely	1
girl	1
eagerly	1
communicated	1
her	1

she	1
was	1
not	1

the	1

of	1
a	1

their	1
eldest	1

just	1
born	1
the	1

of	1
their	1
charge	1
was	1
one	1
of	1

of	1
the	1

exerted	1
himself	1
to	1

the	1
liberty	1

became	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
its	1
weakness	1
whether	1
he	1

or	1
still	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
austria	1

not	1

his	1
property	1
was	1
confiscated	1
his	1

became	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
beggar	1
she	1
continued	1
with	1
her	1
foster	1
parents	1
and	1
bloomed	1
in	1
their	1
rude	1
abode	1
fairer	1
than	1
a	1
garden	1
rose	1
among	1
dark	1
leaved	1
brambles	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
returned	1
from	1
milan	1
he	1
found	1
playing	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
our	1
villa	1
a	1
child	1
fairer	1
than	1
pictured	1
cherub	1
a	1
creature	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
shed	1
radiance	1
from	1
her	1
looks	1
and	1
whose	1
form	1
and	1
motions	1
were	1
lighter	1
than	1
the	1
chamois	1
of	1
the	1
hills	1
the	1
apparition	1
was	1
soon	1
explained	1
with	1
his	1
permission	1
my	1
mother	1
prevailed	1
on	1
her	1
rustic	1
guardians	1
to	1
yield	1
their	1
charge	1
to	1
her	1
they	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
sweet	1
orphan	1
her	1
presence	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
blessing	1
to	1
them	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unfair	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
in	1
poverty	1
and	1
want	1
when	1
providence	1
afforded	1
her	1
such	1
powerful	1
protection	1
they	1
consulted	1
their	1
village	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
that	1
elizabeth	1

became	1
the	1
inmate	1
of	1
my	1

my	1
more	1

i	1
with	1
childish	1

interpreted	1

of	1
a	1
calmer	1
and	1
more	1

disposition	1

with	1
all	1
my	1
ardour	1
i	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1

intense	1
application	1
and	1
was	1
more	1
deeply	1
smitten	1
with	1
the	1
thirst	1

herself	1

ample	1

can	1

on	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
son	1
my	1
junior	1
by	1
seven	1
years	1
my	1

gave	1
up	1
entirely	1
their	1
wandering	1

fixed	1
themselves	1
in	1

principally	1
in	1

latter	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
were	1
passed	1
in	1
considerable	1
seclusion	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
temper	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
crowd	1
and	1
to	1
attach	1
myself	1
fervently	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
i	1
was	1
indifferent	1
therefore	1
to	1
my	1
school	1

i	1
united	1
myself	1
in	1

the	1

henry	1
clerval	1

the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
merchant	1
of	1
geneva	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
singular	1
talent	1
and	1
fancy	1
he	1
loved	1
enterprise	1
hardship	1
and	1
even	1
danger	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
he	1
was	1
deeply	1
read	1
in	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
romance	1
he	1
composed	1
heroic	1
songs	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
many	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
enchantment	1
and	1
knightly	1
adventure	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
act	1

and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
masquerades	1
in	1

myself	1
my	1
parents	1
were	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
spirit	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
indulgence	1
we	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
tyrants	1
to	1
rule	1
our	1
lot	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
caprice	1

the	1
agents	1
and	1
creators	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
many	1
delights	1
which	1
we	1
enjoyed	1
when	1
i	1
mingled	1
with	1
other	1
families	1
i	1
distinctly	1
discerned	1
how	1
peculiarly	1
fortunate	1
my	1
lot	1
was	1

gratitude	1
assisted	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
filial	1
love	1
my	1
temper	1
was	1
sometimes	1
violent	1
and	1
my	1
passions	1
vehement	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
temperature	1
they	1
were	1
turned	1
not	1
towards	1
childish	1
pursuits	1
but	1
to	1
an	1
eager	1
desire	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
learn	1
all	1
things	1
indiscriminately	1
i	1
confess	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
languages	1
nor	1
the	1
code	1
of	1
governments	1
nor	1
the	1
politics	1
of	1

attractions	1
for	1

it	1
was	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
that	1
i	1
desired	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
outward	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
or	1
the	1
inner	1
spirit	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
mysterious	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
occupied	1
me	1
still	1
my	1
inquiries	1
were	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
metaphysical	1
or	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
sense	1
the	1
physical	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
meanwhile	1
clerval	1
occupied	1
himself	1
so	1
to	1

the	1

stage	1
of	1

pleasure	1
in	1
dwelling	1
on	1
the	1
recollections	1
of	1
childhood	1
before	1

tainted	1
my	1

changed	1
its	1

i	1
also	1
record	1
those	1
events	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
insensible	1
steps	1
to	1
my	1
after	1
tale	1
of	1
misery	1
for	1
when	1
i	1
would	1
account	1
to	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
that	1
passion	1
which	1
afterwards	1
ruled	1
my	1
destiny	1
i	1
find	1
it	1
arise	1
like	1
a	1
mountain	1
river	1
from	1
ignoble	1
and	1
almost	1
forgotten	1
sources	1
but	1
swelling	1
as	1
it	1
proceeded	1
it	1
became	1
the	1
torrent	1
which	1
in	1
its	1
course	1
has	1
swept	1
away	1
all	1
my	1
hopes	1
and	1
joys	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
is	1
the	1
genius	1
that	1
has	1
regulated	1
my	1
fate	1
i	1
desire	1
therefore	1
in	1
this	1
narration	1
to	1
state	1
those	1
facts	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
my	1
predilection	1
for	1
that	1
science	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
thirteen	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
we	1
all	1
went	1
on	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
baths	1
near	1
thonon	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
obliged	1
us	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
day	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
i	1
chanced	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
i	1
opened	1
it	1
with	1
apathy	1
the	1
theory	1
which	1
he	1
attempts	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
and	1
the	1
wonderful	1
facts	1
which	1
he	1
relates	1
soon	1
changed	1
this	1
feeling	1
into	1
enthusiasm	1
a	1
new	1
light	1
seemed	1
to	1
dawn	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
bounding	1
with	1
joy	1
i	1
communicated	1
my	1
discovery	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
my	1
father	1
looked	1
carelessly	1
at	1
the	1
title	1
page	1
of	1
my	1
book	1
and	1
said	1
ah	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
do	1
not	1
waste	1
your	1
time	1
upon	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
sad	1
trash	1
if	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
remark	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
pains	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
agrippa	1
had	1
been	1
entirely	1
exploded	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
modern	1
system	1
of	1
science	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
which	1
possessed	1
much	1
greater	1
powers	1
than	1
the	1
ancient	1
because	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
were	1
chimerical	1
while	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
were	1
real	1
and	1
practical	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
i	1
should	1
certainly	1
have	1
thrown	1
agrippa	1
aside	1
and	1
have	1
contented	1
my	1
imagination	1
warmed	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
returning	1
with	1
greater	1
ardour	1
to	1
my	1
former	1
studies	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
my	1
ideas	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
fatal	1
impulse	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
my	1
ruin	1
but	1
the	1
cursory	1
glance	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
my	1
volume	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
its	1
contents	1
and	1
i	1
continued	1
to	1
read	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
avidity	1
when	1
i	1
returned	1
home	1
my	1
first	1
care	1
was	1
to	1
procure	1
the	1
whole	1
works	1
of	1
this	1
author	1
and	1
afterwards	1
of	1
paracelsus	1
and	1
albertus	1
magnus	1
i	1
read	1
and	1
studied	1
the	1
wild	1
fancies	1
of	1
these	1
writers	1
with	1
delight	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
treasures	1
known	1
to	1
few	1
besides	1
myself	1
i	1
have	1
described	1
myself	1
as	1
always	1
having	1
been	1
imbued	1
with	1
a	1
fervent	1
longing	1
to	1
penetrate	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
nature	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
intense	1
labour	1
and	1
wonderful	1
discoveries	1
of	1
modern	1
philosophers	1
i	1
always	1
came	1
from	1
my	1
studies	1
discontented	1
and	1
unsatisfied	1
sir	1
isaac	1
newton	1

said	1
to	1
have	1
avowed	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
picking	1
up	1
shells	1
beside	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
unexplored	1
ocean	1
of	1
truth	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
successors	1
in	1
each	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
acquainted	1
appeared	1
even	1
to	1
my	1
boy	1
s	1
apprehensions	1
as	1
tyros	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pursuit	1
the	1
untaught	1
peasant	1
beheld	1
the	1
elements	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
their	1
practical	1
uses	1
the	1
most	1
learned	1
philosopher	1
knew	1
little	1
more	1
he	1
had	1
partially	1
unveiled	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
nature	1
but	1
her	1
immortal	1
lineaments	1
were	1
still	1
a	1
wonder	1
and	1
a	1
mystery	1
he	1
might	1
dissect	1
anatomize	1
and	1
give	1
names	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
final	1
cause	1
causes	1
in	1
their	1
secondary	1
and	1
tertiary	1
grades	1
were	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
gazed	1
upon	1
the	1
fortifications	1
and	1
impediments	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
keep	1
human	1
beings	1
from	1
entering	1
the	1
citadel	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
rashly	1
and	1
ignorantly	1
i	1
had	1
repined	1
but	1
here	1
were	1
books	1
and	1
here	1
were	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
penetrated	1
deeper	1
and	1
knew	1
more	1
i	1
took	1
their	1
word	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
averred	1
and	1
i	1
became	1
their	1
disciple	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
strange	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
arise	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
century	1
but	1
while	1
i	1
followed	1
the	1
routine	1
of	1
education	1
in	1
the	1
schools	1
of	1
geneva	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
self	1
taught	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
favourite	1
studies	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
scientific	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
struggle	1
with	1
a	1
child	1
s	1
blindness	1
added	1
to	1
a	1
student	1
s	1
thirst	1
for	1
knowledge	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
preceptors	1
i	1
entered	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
diligence	1
into	1
the	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
philosopher	1
s	1
stone	1
and	1
the	1
elixir	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
soon	1
obtained	1
my	1
undivided	1
attention	1
wealth	1
was	1
an	1
inferior	1
object	1
but	1
what	1
glory	1
would	1
attend	1
the	1
discovery	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
banish	1
disease	1
from	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
and	1
render	1
man	1
invulnerable	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
violent	1
death	1
nor	1
were	1
these	1
my	1
only	1
visions	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
ghosts	1
or	1
devils	1
was	1
a	1
promise	1
liberally	1
accorded	1
by	1
my	1
favourite	1
authors	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
most	1
eagerly	1
sought	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
incantations	1
were	1
always	1
unsuccessful	1
i	1
attributed	1
the	1
failure	1
rather	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
inexperience	1
and	1
mistake	1
than	1
to	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
skill	1
or	1
fidelity	1
in	1
my	1
instructors	1
and	1
thus	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
exploded	1
systems	1
mingling	1
like	1
an	1
unadept	1
a	1
thousand	1
contradictory	1
theories	1
and	1
floundering	1
desperately	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
slough	1
of	1
multifarious	1
knowledge	1
guided	1
by	1
an	1
ardent	1
imagination	1
and	1
childish	1
reasoning	1
till	1
an	1
accident	1
again	1
changed	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
my	1
ideas	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
old	1
we	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
our	1
house	1
near	1
belrive	1
when	1
we	1
witnessed	1
a	1
most	1
violent	1
and	1
terrible	1
thunderstorm	1
it	1
advanced	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
jura	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
burst	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
frightful	1
loudness	1
from	1
various	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
i	1
remained	1
while	1
the	1
storm	1
lasted	1
watching	1
its	1
progress	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
delight	1
as	1
i	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
a	1
sudden	1
i	1
beheld	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
fire	1
issue	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
beautiful	1
oak	1
which	1
stood	1
about	1
twenty	1
yards	1
from	1
our	1
house	1
and	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
dazzling	1
light	1
vanished	1
the	1
oak	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
nothing	1
remained	1
but	1
a	1
blasted	1
stump	1
when	1
we	1
visited	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
tree	1
shattered	1
in	1
a	1
singular	1
manner	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
splintered	1
by	1
the	1
shock	1
but	1
entirely	1
reduced	1
to	1
thin	1
ribbons	1
of	1
wood	1
i	1
never	1
beheld	1
anything	1
so	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
before	1
this	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
laws	1
of	1
electricity	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
research	1
in	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
was	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
excited	1
by	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
he	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
a	1
theory	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
electricity	1
and	1
galvanism	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
new	1
and	1
astonishing	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
threw	1
greatly	1
into	1
the	1
shade	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
albertus	1
magnus	1
and	1
paracelsus	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
my	1
imagination	1
but	1
by	1
some	1
fatality	1
the	1
overthrow	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
disinclined	1
me	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
accustomed	1
studies	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
would	1
or	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
known	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
engaged	1
my	1
attention	1
suddenly	1
grew	1
despicable	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
caprices	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
perhaps	1
most	1
subject	1
to	1
in	1
early	1
youth	1
i	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
up	1
my	1
former	1
occupations	1
set	1
down	1
natural	1
history	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
progeny	1
as	1
a	1
deformed	1
and	1
abortive	1
creation	1
and	1
entertained	1
the	1
greatest	1
disdain	1
for	1
a	1
would	1
be	1
science	1
which	1
could	1
never	1
even	1
step	1
within	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
real	1
knowledge	1
in	1
this	1
mood	1
of	1
mind	1
i	1
betook	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
study	1
appertaining	1
to	1
that	1
science	1
as	1
being	1
built	1
upon	1
secure	1
foundations	1
and	1
so	1
worthy	1
of	1
my	1
consideration	1
thus	1
strangely	1
are	1
our	1
souls	1
constructed	1
and	1
by	1
such	1
slight	1
ligaments	1
are	1
we	1
bound	1
to	1
prosperity	1
or	1
ruin	1
when	1
i	1
look	1
back	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
this	1
almost	1
miraculous	1
change	1
of	1
inclination	1
and	1
will	1
was	1
the	1
immediate	1
suggestion	1
of	1
the	1
guardian	1
angel	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
the	1
last	1
effort	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
preservation	1
to	1
avert	1
the	1
storm	1
that	1
was	1
even	1
then	1
hanging	1
in	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
envelop	1
me	1
her	1
victory	1
was	1
announced	1
by	1
an	1
unusual	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
gladness	1
of	1
soul	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
relinquishing	1
of	1
my	1
ancient	1
and	1
latterly	1
tormenting	1
studies	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
taught	1
to	1
associate	1
evil	1
with	1
their	1
prosecution	1
happiness	1
with	1
their	1
disregard	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
good	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
ineffectual	1
destiny	1
was	1
too	1
potent	1
and	1
her	1
immutable	1
laws	1
had	1
decreed	1
my	1
utter	1
and	1
terrible	1
destruction	1
chapter	1

when	1
i	1
had	1
attained	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
seventeen	1
my	1
parents	1
resolved	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
become	1
a	1
student	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
of	1
ingolstadt	1
i	1
had	1
hitherto	1
attended	1
the	1
schools	1
of	1
geneva	1
but	1
my	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
education	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
other	1
customs	1
than	1
those	1

she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
during	1
her	1
illness	1
many	1
arguments	1
had	1
been	1
urged	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1

to	1
refrain	1
from	1
attending	1
upon	1
her	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
yielded	1
to	1
our	1
entreaties	1

when	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
life	1

the	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
imprudence	1
were	1
fatal	1
to	1
her	1

on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
my	1
mother	1

her	1

by	1
the	1

symptoms	1

these	1

will	1

in	1

the	1
feelings	1
of	1
those	1

by	1
that	1
most	1

evil	1
the	1

to	1
the	1

the	1

on	1
the	1
countenance	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
long	1
before	1
the	1

can	1
persuade	1
itself	1
that	1
she	1
whom	1
we	1
saw	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
whose	1
very	1
existence	1
appeared	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
can	1
have	1
departed	1
forever	1
that	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
a	1
beloved	1
eye	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
extinguished	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
familiar	1
and	1
dear	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
can	1
be	1
hushed	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
reflections	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
days	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
time	1
proves	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
then	1
the	1
actual	1
bitterness	1
of	1
grief	1
commences	1
yet	1
from	1
whom	1
has	1
not	1
that	1
rude	1
hand	1
rent	1
away	1
some	1
dear	1
connection	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
describe	1
a	1
sorrow	1
which	1
all	1
have	1
felt	1
and	1
must	1
feel	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
length	1
arrives	1
when	1
grief	1
is	1
rather	1
an	1
indulgence	1
than	1
a	1
necessity	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
that	1
plays	1
upon	1
the	1
lips	1
although	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
a	1
sacrilege	1
is	1
not	1
banished	1
my	1
mother	1
was	1
dead	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
still	1
duties	1
which	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
perform	1
we	1
must	1
continue	1
our	1
course	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
learn	1
to	1
think	1
ourselves	1
fortunate	1
whilst	1
one	1
remains	1
whom	1
the	1
spoiler	1
has	1
not	1
seized	1
my	1
departure	1
for	1
ingolstadt	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
deferred	1
by	1
these	1
events	1
was	1
now	1
again	1
determined	1
upon	1
i	1
obtained	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
a	1
respite	1
of	1
some	1
weeks	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
sacrilege	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
repose	1
akin	1
to	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
and	1
to	1
rush	1
into	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
life	1
i	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
sorrow	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
alarm	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
i	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
sweet	1
elizabeth	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
consoled	1
she	1
indeed	1
veiled	1
her	1
grief	1
and	1
strove	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
comforter	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
she	1
looked	1
steadily	1
on	1
life	1
and	1
assumed	1
its	1
duties	1
with	1
courage	1
and	1
zeal	1
she	1
devoted	1
herself	1
to	1
those	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
cousins	1
never	1
was	1
she	1
so	1
enchanting	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
sunshine	1
of	1
her	1
smiles	1
and	1
spent	1
them	1
upon	1
us	1
she	1
forgot	1
even	1
her	1
own	1
regret	1
in	1
her	1
endeavours	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
forget	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
at	1
length	1
arrived	1
clerval	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
evening	1
with	1
us	1
he	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
become	1
my	1
fellow	1
student	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
narrow	1
minded	1
trader	1
and	1
saw	1
idleness	1
and	1
ruin	1
in	1
the	1
aspirations	1
and	1
ambition	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
henry	1
deeply	1
felt	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
being	1
debarred	1
from	1
a	1
liberal	1
education	1
he	1
said	1
little	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
i	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
kindling	1
eye	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
animated	1
glance	1
a	1
restrained	1
but	1
firm	1
resolve	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
chained	1
to	1
the	1
miserable	1
details	1
of	1
commerce	1
we	1
sat	1
late	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
ourselves	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
nor	1
persuade	1
ourselves	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
farewell	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
and	1
we	1
retired	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
seeking	1
repose	1
each	1
fancying	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
deceived	1
but	1
when	1
at	1
morning	1
s	1
dawn	1
i	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
there	1
my	1
father	1
again	1
to	1
bless	1
me	1
clerval	1
to	1
press	1
my	1
hand	1
once	1
more	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
renew	1
her	1
entreaties	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
write	1
often	1
and	1
to	1
bestow	1
the	1
last	1
feminine	1
attentions	1
on	1
her	1
playmate	1
and	1
friend	1
i	1
threw	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
chaise	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
and	1
indulged	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
melancholy	1
reflections	1
i	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
surrounded	1
by	1
amiable	1
companions	1
continually	1
engaged	1
in	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
bestow	1
mutual	1
pleasure	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
university	1
whither	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
i	1
must	1
form	1
my	1
own	1
friends	1
and	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
protector	1
my	1
life	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
remarkably	1
secluded	1
and	1
domestic	1
and	1
this	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
invincible	1
repugnance	1
to	1
new	1
countenances	1
i	1
loved	1
my	1
brothers	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
clerval	1
these	1
were	1
old	1
familiar	1
faces	1
but	1
i	1
believed	1
myself	1
totally	1
unfitted	1
for	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
strangers	1
such	1
were	1
my	1
reflections	1
as	1
i	1
commenced	1
my	1
journey	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
proceeded	1
my	1
spirits	1
and	1
hopes	1
rose	1
i	1
ardently	1
desired	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
knowledge	1
i	1
had	1
often	1
when	1
at	1
home	1
thought	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
remain	1
during	1
my	1
youth	1
cooped	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
and	1
had	1
longed	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
station	1
among	1
other	1
human	1
beings	1
now	1
my	1
desires	1
were	1
complied	1
with	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
folly	1
to	1
repent	1
i	1
had	1
sufficient	1
leisure	1
for	1
these	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
reflections	1
during	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
ingolstadt	1
which	1
was	1
long	1
and	1
fatiguing	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
high	1
white	1
steeple	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
met	1
my	1
eyes	1
i	1
alighted	1
and	1
was	1
conducted	1
to	1
my	1
solitary	1
apartment	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
as	1
i	1
pleased	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
i	1
delivered	1
my	1
letters	1
of	1
introduction	1
and	1
paid	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
professors	1
chance	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
evil	1
influence	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
destruction	1
which	1
asserted	1
omnipotent	1
sway	1
over	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
i	1
turned	1
my	1
reluctant	1
steps	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
door	1
led	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
m	1
krempe	1
professor	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
uncouth	1
man	1
but	1
deeply	1
imbued	1
in	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
science	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
several	1
questions	1
concerning	1
my	1
progress	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
science	1
appertaining	1
to	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
i	1
replied	1
carelessly	1
and	1
partly	1
in	1
contempt	1
mentioned	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
my	1
alchemists	1
as	1
the	1
principal	1
authors	1
i	1
had	1
studied	1
the	1
professor	1
stared	1
have	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
really	1
spent	1
your	1
time	1
in	1
studying	1
such	1
nonsense	1
i	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
every	1
minute	1
continued	1
m	1
krempe	1
with	1
warmth	1
every	1
instant	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
wasted	1
on	1
those	1
books	1
is	1
utterly	1
and	1
entirely	1
lost	1
you	1
have	1
burdened	1
your	1
memory	1
with	1
exploded	1
systems	1
and	1
useless	1
names	1
good	1
god	1
in	1
what	1
desert	1
land	1
have	1
you	1
lived	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
inform	1
you	1
that	1
these	1
fancies	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
greedily	1
imbibed	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
as	1
musty	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
ancient	1
i	1
little	1
expected	1
in	1
this	1
enlightened	1
and	1
scientific	1
age	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
albertus	1
magnus	1
and	1
paracelsus	1
my	1
dear	1
sir	1
you	1
must	1
begin	1
your	1
studies	1
entirely	1
anew	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
stepped	1
aside	1
and	1
wrote	1
down	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
several	1
books	1
treating	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
dismissed	1
me	1
after	1
mentioning	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
week	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
commence	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
lectures	1
upon	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
in	1
its	1
general	1
relations	1
and	1
that	1
m	1
waldman	1
a	1
fellow	1
professor	1
would	1
lecture	1
upon	1
chemistry	1
the	1
alternate	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
omitted	1
i	1
returned	1
home	1
not	1
disappointed	1
for	1
i	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
long	1
considered	1
those	1
authors	1
useless	1
whom	1
the	1
professor	1
reprobated	1
but	1
i	1
returned	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
these	1
studies	1
in	1
any	1
shape	1
m	1
krempe	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
squat	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gruff	1
voice	1
and	1
a	1
repulsive	1
countenance	1
the	1
teacher	1
therefore	1
did	1
not	1
prepossess	1
me	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
too	1
philosophical	1
and	1
connected	1
a	1
strain	1
perhaps	1
i	1
have	1
given	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
conclusions	1
i	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
concerning	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
early	1
years	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
results	1
promised	1
by	1
the	1
modern	1
professors	1
of	1
natural	1
science	1
with	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
ideas	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
my	1
extreme	1
youth	1
and	1
my	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
guide	1
on	1
such	1
matters	1
i	1
had	1
retrod	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
knowledge	1
along	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
exchanged	1
the	1
discoveries	1
of	1
recent	1
inquirers	1
for	1
the	1
dreams	1
of	1
forgotten	1
alchemists	1
besides	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
modern	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
when	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
sought	1
immortality	1
and	1
power	1
such	1
views	1
although	1
futile	1
were	1
grand	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
scene	1
was	1
changed	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
the	1
inquirer	1
seemed	1
to	1
limit	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
annihilation	1
of	1
those	1
visions	1
on	1
which	1
my	1
interest	1
in	1
science	1
was	1
chiefly	1
founded	1
i	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
exchange	1
chimeras	1
of	1
boundless	1
grandeur	1
for	1
realities	1
of	1
little	1
worth	1
such	1
were	1
my	1
reflections	1
during	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
residence	1
at	1
ingolstadt	1
which	1
were	1
chiefly	1
spent	1
in	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
localities	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
residents	1
in	1
my	1
new	1
abode	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
ensuing	1
week	1
commenced	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
information	1
which	1
m	1
krempe	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
concerning	1
the	1
lectures	1
and	1
although	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
hear	1
that	1
little	1
conceited	1
fellow	1
deliver	1
sentences	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pulpit	1
i	1
recollected	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
m	1
waldman	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
town	1
partly	1
from	1
curiosity	1
and	1
partly	1
from	1
idleness	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
lecturing	1
room	1
which	1
m	1
waldman	1
entered	1
shortly	1
after	1
this	1
professor	1
was	1
very	1
unlike	1
his	1
colleague	1
he	1
appeared	1
about	1
fifty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
but	1
with	1
an	1
aspect	1
expressive	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
benevolence	1
a	1
few	1
grey	1
hairs	1
covered	1
his	1
temples	1
but	1
those	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
nearly	1
black	1
his	1
person	1
was	1
short	1
but	1
remarkably	1
erect	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
the	1
sweetest	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
he	1
began	1
his	1
lecture	1
by	1
a	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
chemistry	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
improvements	1
made	1
by	1
different	1
men	1
of	1
learning	1
pronouncing	1
with	1
fervour	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
discoverers	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
a	1
cursory	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
and	1
explained	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
elementary	1
terms	1
after	1
having	1
made	1
a	1
few	1
preparatory	1
experiments	1
he	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
panegyric	1
upon	1
modern	1
chemistry	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
ancient	1
teachers	1
of	1
this	1
science	1
said	1
he	1
promised	1
impossibilities	1
and	1
performed	1
nothing	1
the	1
modern	1
masters	1
promise	1
very	1
little	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
metals	1
cannot	1
be	1
transmuted	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
elixir	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
chimera	1
but	1
these	1
philosophers	1
whose	1
hands	1
seem	1
only	1
made	1
to	1
dabble	1
in	1
dirt	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
pore	1
over	1
the	1
microscope	1
or	1
crucible	1
have	1
indeed	1
performed	1
miracles	1
they	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
show	1
how	1
she	1
works	1
in	1
her	1
hiding	1
places	1
they	1
ascend	1
into	1
the	1
heavens	1
they	1
have	1
discovered	1
how	1
the	1
blood	1
circulates	1
and	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
we	1
breathe	1
they	1
have	1
acquired	1
new	1
and	1
almost	1
unlimited	1
powers	1
they	1
can	1
command	1
the	1
thunders	1
of	1
heaven	1
mimic	1
the	1
earthquake	1
and	1
even	1
mock	1
the	1
invisible	1
world	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
shadows	1
such	1
were	1
the	1
professor	1
s	1
words	1
rather	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
such	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
enounced	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
my	1
soul	1
were	1
grappling	1
with	1
a	1
palpable	1
enemy	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
various	1
keys	1
were	1
touched	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
chord	1
after	1
chord	1
was	1
sounded	1
and	1
soon	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
one	1
thought	1
one	1
conception	1
one	1
purpose	1
so	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
frankenstein	1
more	1
far	1
more	1
will	1
i	1
achieve	1
treading	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
already	1
marked	1
i	1
will	1
pioneer	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
explore	1
unknown	1
powers	1
and	1
unfold	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
deepest	1
mysteries	1
of	1
creation	1
i	1
closed	1
not	1
my	1
eyes	1
that	1
night	1
my	1
internal	1
being	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
insurrection	1
and	1
turmoil	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
order	1
would	1
thence	1
arise	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
produce	1
it	1
by	1
degrees	1
after	1
the	1
morning	1
s	1
dawn	1
sleep	1
came	1
i	1
awoke	1
and	1
my	1
yesternight	1
s	1
thoughts	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
there	1
only	1
remained	1
a	1
resolution	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
ancient	1
studies	1
and	1
to	1
devote	1
myself	1
to	1
a	1
science	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
believed	1
myself	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
natural	1
talent	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
i	1
paid	1
m	1
waldman	1
a	1
visit	1
his	1
manners	1
in	1
private	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
mild	1
and	1
attractive	1
than	1
in	1
public	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
mien	1
during	1
his	1
lecture	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
greatest	1
affability	1
and	1
kindness	1
i	1
gave	1
him	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
pursuits	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
fellow	1
professor	1
he	1
heard	1
with	1
attention	1
the	1
little	1
narration	1
concerning	1
my	1
studies	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
and	1
paracelsus	1
but	1
without	1
the	1
contempt	1
that	1
m	1
krempe	1
had	1
exhibited	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
to	1
whose	1
indefatigable	1
zeal	1
modern	1
philosophers	1
were	1
indebted	1
for	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
their	1
knowledge	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
an	1
easier	1
task	1
to	1
give	1
new	1
names	1
and	1
arrange	1
in	1
connected	1
classifications	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
they	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
bringing	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
however	1
erroneously	1
directed	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
fail	1
in	1
ultimately	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
solid	1
advantage	1
of	1
mankind	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
statement	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
without	1
any	1
presumption	1
or	1
affectation	1
and	1
then	1
added	1
that	1
his	1
lecture	1
had	1
removed	1
my	1
prejudices	1
against	1
modern	1
chemists	1
i	1
expressed	1
myself	1
in	1
measured	1
terms	1
with	1
the	1
modesty	1
and	1
deference	1
due	1
from	1
a	1
youth	1
to	1
his	1
instructor	1
without	1
letting	1
escape	1
inexperience	1
in	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
ashamed	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
stimulated	1
my	1
intended	1
labours	1
i	1
requested	1
his	1
advice	1
concerning	1
the	1
books	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
procure	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
said	1
m	1
waldman	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
disciple	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
application	1
equals	1
your	1
ability	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
success	1
chemistry	1
is	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
greatest	1
improvements	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
my	1
peculiar	1
study	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
neglected	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
science	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
make	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
sorry	1
chemist	1
if	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
that	1
department	1
of	1
human	1
knowledge	1
alone	1
if	1
your	1
wish	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
really	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
petty	1
experimentalist	1
i	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
every	1
branch	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
including	1
mathematics	1
he	1
then	1
took	1
me	1
into	1
his	1
laboratory	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
uses	1
of	1
his	1
various	1
machines	1
instructing	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
procure	1
and	1
promising	1
me	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
when	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
advanced	1
far	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
not	1
to	1
derange	1
their	1
mechanism	1
he	1
also	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
books	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
requested	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
my	1
leave	1
thus	1
ended	1
a	1
day	1
memorable	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
decided	1
my	1
future	1
destiny	1
chapter	1
4	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
and	1
particularly	1
chemistry	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
comprehensive	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
became	1
nearly	1
my	1
sole	1
occupation	1
i	1
read	1
with	1
ardour	1
those	1
works	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
discrimination	1
which	1
modern	1
inquirers	1
have	1
written	1
on	1
these	1
subjects	1
i	1
attended	1
the	1
lectures	1
and	1
cultivated	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
i	1
found	1
even	1
in	1
m	1
krempe	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
sound	1
sense	1
and	1
real	1
information	1
combined	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
with	1
a	1
repulsive	1
physiognomy	1
and	1
manners	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
the	1
less	1
valuable	1
in	1
m	1
waldman	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
his	1
gentleness	1
was	1
never	1
tinged	1
by	1
dogmatism	1
and	1
his	1
instructions	1
were	1
given	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
frankness	1
and	1
good	1
nature	1
that	1
banished	1
every	1
idea	1
of	1
pedantry	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
he	1
smoothed	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
abstruse	1
inquiries	1
clear	1
and	1
facile	1
to	1
my	1
apprehension	1
my	1
application	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
fluctuating	1
and	1
uncertain	1
it	1
gained	1
strength	1
as	1
i	1
proceeded	1
and	1
soon	1
became	1
so	1
ardent	1
and	1
eager	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
often	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
morning	1
whilst	1
i	1
was	1
yet	1
engaged	1
in	1
my	1
laboratory	1
as	1
i	1
applied	1
so	1
closely	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
conceived	1
that	1
my	1
progress	1
was	1
rapid	1
my	1
ardour	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
students	1
and	1
my	1
proficiency	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
masters	1
professor	1
krempe	1
often	1
asked	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
smile	1
how	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
went	1
on	1
whilst	1
m	1
waldman	1
expressed	1
the	1
most	1
heartfelt	1
exultation	1
in	1
my	1
progress	1
two	1
years	1
passed	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
paid	1
no	1
visit	1
to	1
geneva	1
but	1
was	1
engaged	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
some	1
discoveries	1
which	1
i	1
hoped	1
to	1
make	1
none	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
experienced	1
them	1
can	1
conceive	1
of	1
the	1
enticements	1
of	1
science	1
in	1
other	1
studies	1
you	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
others	1
have	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
know	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
scientific	1
pursuit	1
there	1
is	1
continual	1
food	1
for	1
discovery	1
and	1
wonder	1
a	1
mind	1
of	1
moderate	1
capacity	1
which	1
closely	1
pursues	1
one	1
study	1
must	1
infallibly	1
arrive	1
at	1
great	1
proficiency	1
in	1
that	1
study	1
and	1
i	1
who	1
continually	1
sought	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
one	1
object	1
of	1
pursuit	1
and	1
was	1
solely	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
improved	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
i	1
made	1
some	1
discoveries	1
in	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
some	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
which	1
procured	1
me	1
great	1
esteem	1
and	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
university	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
and	1
had	1
become	1
as	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
theory	1
and	1
practice	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
as	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
professors	1
at	1
ingolstadt	1
my	1
residence	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
longer	1
conducive	1
to	1
my	1
improvements	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
when	1
an	1
incident	1
happened	1
that	1
protracted	1
my	1
stay	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
phenomena	1
which	1
had	1
peculiarly	1
attracted	1
my	1
attention	1
was	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
and	1
indeed	1
any	1
animal	1
endued	1
with	1
life	1
whence	1
i	1
often	1
asked	1
myself	1
did	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
life	1
proceed	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
bold	1
question	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
mystery	1
yet	1
with	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
are	1
we	1
upon	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
if	1
cowardice	1
or	1
carelessness	1
did	1
not	1
restrain	1
our	1
inquiries	1
i	1
revolved	1
these	1
circumstances	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
determined	1
thenceforth	1
to	1
apply	1
myself	1
more	1
particularly	1
to	1
those	1
branches	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
physiology	1
unless	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
animated	1
by	1
an	1
almost	1
supernatural	1
enthusiasm	1
my	1
application	1
to	1
this	1
study	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
irksome	1
and	1
almost	1
intolerable	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
life	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
death	1
i	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
anatomy	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
sufficient	1
i	1
must	1
also	1
observe	1
the	1
natural	1
decay	1
and	1
corruption	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
body	1
in	1
my	1
education	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
greatest	1
precautions	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
should	1
be	1
impressed	1
with	1
no	1
supernatural	1
horrors	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
ever	1
remember	1
to	1
have	1
trembled	1
at	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
superstition	1
or	1
to	1
have	1
feared	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
darkness	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
upon	1
my	1
fancy	1
and	1
a	1
churchyard	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
merely	1
the	1
receptacle	1
of	1
bodies	1
deprived	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
from	1
being	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
strength	1
had	1
become	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
worm	1
now	1
i	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
cause	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
this	1
decay	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
spend	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
in	1
vaults	1
and	1
charnel	1
houses	1
my	1
attention	1
was	1
fixed	1
upon	1
every	1
object	1
the	1
most	1
insupportable	1
to	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
feelings	1
i	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
fine	1
form	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
degraded	1
and	1
wasted	1
i	1
beheld	1
the	1
corruption	1
of	1
death	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
blooming	1
cheek	1
of	1
life	1
i	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
worm	1
inherited	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
brain	1
i	1
paused	1
examining	1
and	1
analysing	1
all	1
the	1
minutiae	1
of	1
causation	1
as	1
exemplified	1
in	1
the	1
change	1
from	1
life	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
death	1
to	1
life	1
until	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
darkness	1
a	1
sudden	1
light	1
broke	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
a	1
light	1
so	1
brilliant	1
and	1
wondrous	1
yet	1
so	1
simple	1
that	1
while	1
i	1
became	1
dizzy	1
with	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
the	1
prospect	1
which	1
it	1
illustrated	1
i	1
was	1
surprised	1
that	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
who	1
had	1
directed	1
their	1
inquiries	1
towards	1
the	1
same	1
science	1
that	1
i	1
alone	1
should	1
be	1
reserved	1
to	1
discover	1
so	1
astonishing	1
a	1
secret	1
remember	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
recording	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
the	1
sun	1
does	1
not	1
more	1
certainly	1
shine	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
i	1
now	1
affirm	1
is	1
true	1
some	1
miracle	1
might	1
have	1
produced	1
it	1
yet	1
the	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
were	1
distinct	1
and	1
probable	1
after	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
of	1
incredible	1
labour	1
and	1
fatigue	1
i	1
succeeded	1
in	1
discovering	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
generation	1
and	1
life	1
nay	1
more	1
i	1
became	1
myself	1
capable	1
of	1
bestowing	1
animation	1
upon	1
lifeless	1
matter	1
the	1
astonishment	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
experienced	1
on	1
this	1
discovery	1
soon	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
delight	1
and	1
rapture	1
after	1
so	1
much	1
time	1
spent	1
in	1
painful	1
labour	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
my	1
desires	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
gratifying	1
consummation	1
of	1
my	1
toils	1
but	1
this	1
discovery	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
overwhelming	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
progressively	1
led	1
to	1
it	1
were	1
obliterated	1
and	1
i	1
beheld	1
only	1
the	1
result	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
study	1
and	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
wisest	1
men	1
since	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
now	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
not	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
magic	1
scene	1
it	1
all	1
opened	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
information	1
i	1
had	1
obtained	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
rather	1
to	1
direct	1
my	1
endeavours	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
point	1
them	1
towards	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
search	1
than	1
to	1
exhibit	1
that	1
object	1
already	1
accomplished	1
i	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
arabian	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
buried	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
life	1
aided	1
only	1
by	1
one	1
glimmering	1
and	1
seemingly	1
ineffectual	1
light	1
i	1
see	1
by	1
your	1
eagerness	1
and	1
the	1
wonder	1
and	1
hope	1
which	1
your	1
eyes	1
express	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
acquainted	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
listen	1
patiently	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
easily	1
perceive	1
why	1
i	1
am	1
reserved	1
upon	1
that	1
subject	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
lead	1
you	1
on	1
unguarded	1
and	1
ardent	1
as	1
i	1
then	1
was	1
to	1
your	1
destruction	1
and	1
infallible	1
misery	1
learn	1
from	1
me	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
precepts	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
my	1
example	1
how	1
dangerous	1
is	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
happier	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
who	1
believes	1
his	1
native	1
town	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
aspires	1
to	1
become	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
nature	1
will	1
allow	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
so	1
astonishing	1
a	1
power	1
placed	1
within	1
my	1
hands	1
i	1
hesitated	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
concerning	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
employ	1
it	1
although	1
i	1
possessed	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
bestowing	1
animation	1
yet	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
frame	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
intricacies	1
of	1
fibres	1
muscles	1
and	1
veins	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
inconceivable	1
difficulty	1
and	1
labour	1
i	1
doubted	1
at	1
first	1
whether	1
i	1
should	1
attempt	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
being	1
like	1
myself	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
simpler	1
organization	1
but	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
exalted	1
by	1
my	1
first	1
success	1
to	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
to	1
an	1
animal	1
as	1
complex	1
and	1
wonderful	1
as	1
man	1
the	1
materials	1
at	1
present	1
within	1
my	1
command	1
hardly	1
appeared	1
adequate	1
to	1
so	1
arduous	1
an	1
undertaking	1
but	1
i	1
doubted	1
not	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
ultimately	1
succeed	1
i	1
prepared	1
myself	1
for	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
reverses	1
my	1
operations	1
might	1
be	1
incessantly	1
baffled	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
my	1
work	1
be	1
imperfect	1
yet	1
when	1
i	1
considered	1
the	1
improvement	1
which	1
every	1
day	1
takes	1
place	1
in	1
science	1
and	1
mechanics	1
i	1
was	1
encouraged	1
to	1
hope	1
my	1
present	1
attempts	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
lay	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
future	1
success	1
nor	1
could	1
i	1
consider	1
the	1
magnitude	1
and	1
complexity	1
of	1
my	1
plan	1
as	1
any	1
argument	1
of	1
its	1
impracticability	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
these	1
feelings	1
that	1
i	1
began	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
as	1
the	1
minuteness	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
formed	1
a	1
great	1
hindrance	1
to	1
my	1
speed	1
i	1
resolved	1
contrary	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
intention	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
eight	1
feet	1
in	1
height	1
and	1
proportionably	1
large	1
after	1
having	1
formed	1
this	1
determination	1
and	1
having	1
spent	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
successfully	1
collecting	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
materials	1
i	1
began	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
feelings	1
which	1
bore	1
me	1
onwards	1
like	1
a	1
hurricane	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
success	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
ideal	1
bounds	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
first	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
pour	1
a	1
torrent	1
of	1
light	1
into	1
our	1
dark	1
world	1
a	1
new	1
species	1
would	1
bless	1
me	1
as	1
its	1
creator	1
and	1
source	1
many	1
happy	1
and	1
excellent	1
natures	1
would	1
owe	1
their	1
being	1
to	1
me	1
no	1
father	1
could	1
claim	1
the	1
gratitude	1
of	1
his	1
child	1
so	1
completely	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
deserve	1
theirs	1
pursuing	1
these	1
reflections	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
bestow	1
animation	1
upon	1
lifeless	1
matter	1
i	1
might	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
although	1
i	1
now	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
renew	1
life	1
where	1
death	1
had	1
apparently	1
devoted	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
corruption	1
these	1
thoughts	1
supported	1
my	1
spirits	1
while	1
i	1
pursued	1
my	1
undertaking	1
with	1
unremitting	1
ardour	1
my	1
cheek	1
had	1
grown	1
pale	1
with	1
study	1
and	1
my	1
person	1
had	1
become	1
emaciated	1
with	1
confinement	1
sometimes	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
brink	1
of	1
certainty	1
i	1
failed	1
yet	1
still	1
i	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
or	1
the	1
next	1
hour	1
might	1
realize	1
one	1
secret	1
which	1
i	1
alone	1
possessed	1
was	1
the	1
hope	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
dedicated	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
gazed	1
on	1
my	1
midnight	1
labours	1
while	1
with	1
unrelaxed	1
and	1
breathless	1
eagerness	1
i	1
pursued	1
nature	1
to	1
her	1
hiding	1
places	1
who	1
shall	1
conceive	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
my	1
secret	1
toil	1
as	1
i	1
dabbled	1
among	1
the	1
unhallowed	1
damps	1
of	1
the	1
grave	1
or	1
tortured	1
the	1
living	1
animal	1
to	1
animate	1
the	1
lifeless	1
clay	1
my	1
limbs	1
now	1
tremble	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
swim	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
but	1
then	1
a	1
resistless	1
and	1
almost	1
frantic	1
impulse	1
urged	1
me	1
forward	1
i	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
all	1
soul	1
or	1
sensation	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
pursuit	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
but	1
a	1
passing	1
trance	1
that	1
only	1
made	1
me	1
feel	1
with	1
renewed	1
acuteness	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
unnatural	1
stimulus	1
ceasing	1
to	1
operate	1
i	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
habits	1
i	1
collected	1
bones	1
from	1
charnel	1
houses	1
and	1
disturbed	1
with	1
profane	1
fingers	1
the	1
tremendous	1
secrets	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
in	1
a	1
solitary	1
chamber	1
or	1
rather	1
cell	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
separated	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
apartments	1
by	1
a	1
gallery	1
and	1
staircase	1
i	1
kept	1
my	1
workshop	1
of	1
filthy	1
creation	1
my	1
eyeballs	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
my	1
employment	1
the	1
dissecting	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
slaughter	1
house	1
furnished	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
materials	1
and	1
often	1
did	1
my	1
human	1
nature	1
turn	1
with	1
loathing	1
from	1
my	1
occupation	1
whilst	1
still	1
urged	1
on	1
by	1
an	1
eagerness	1
which	1
perpetually	1
increased	1
i	1
brought	1
my	1
work	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1
the	1
summer	1
months	1
passed	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
thus	1
engaged	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
in	1
one	1
pursuit	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
beautiful	1
season	1
never	1
did	1
the	1
fields	1
bestow	1
a	1
more	1
plentiful	1
harvest	1
or	1
the	1
vines	1
yield	1
a	1
more	1
luxuriant	1
vintage	1
but	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
insensible	1
to	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
neglect	1
the	1
scenes	1
around	1
me	1
caused	1
me	1
also	1
to	1
forget	1
those	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
miles	1
absent	1
and	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time	1
i	1
knew	1
my	1
silence	1
disquieted	1
them	1
and	1
i	1
well	1
remembered	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
pleased	1
with	1
yourself	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
affection	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
hear	1
regularly	1
from	1
you	1
you	1
must	1
pardon	1
me	1
if	1
i	1
regard	1
any	1
interruption	1
in	1
your	1
correspondence	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
that	1
your	1
other	1
duties	1
are	1
equally	1
neglected	1
i	1
knew	1
well	1
therefore	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
feelings	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
my	1
thoughts	1
from	1
my	1
employment	1
loathsome	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
an	1
irresistible	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
imagination	1
i	1
wished	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
procrastinate	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
my	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
until	1
the	1
great	1
object	1
which	1
swallowed	1
up	1
every	1
habit	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
should	1
be	1
completed	1
i	1
then	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
would	1
be	1
unjust	1
if	1
he	1
ascribed	1
my	1
neglect	1
to	1
vice	1
or	1
faultiness	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
conceiving	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
altogether	1
free	1
from	1
blame	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
in	1
perfection	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
calm	1
and	1
peaceful	1
mind	1
and	1
never	1
to	1
allow	1
passion	1
or	1
a	1
transitory	1
desire	1
to	1
disturb	1
his	1
tranquillity	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
knowledge	1
is	1
an	1
exception	1
to	1
this	1
rule	1
if	1
the	1
study	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
apply	1
yourself	1
has	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
weaken	1
your	1
affections	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
your	1
taste	1
for	1
those	1
simple	1
pleasures	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
alloy	1
can	1
possibly	1

my	1

no	1
reproach	1
in	1

only	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
silence	1
by	1
inquiring	1
into	1
my	1
occupations	1
more	1
particularly	1
than	1
before	1
winter	1
spring	1
and	1
summer	1
passed	1
away	1
during	1
my	1
labours	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
watch	1
the	1
blossom	1
or	1
the	1
expanding	1
leaves	1
sights	1
which	1
before	1
always	1
yielded	1
me	1
supreme	1
delight	1
so	1
deeply	1
was	1
i	1
engrossed	1
in	1
my	1
occupation	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
that	1
year	1
had	1
withered	1
before	1
my	1
work	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
now	1
every	1
day	1
showed	1
me	1
more	1
plainly	1
how	1
well	1
i	1
had	1
succeeded	1
but	1
my	1
enthusiasm	1
was	1
checked	1
by	1
my	1
anxiety	1
and	1
i	1
appeared	1
rather	1
like	1
one	1
doomed	1
by	1
slavery	1
to	1
toil	1
in	1
the	1
mines	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
unwholesome	1
trade	1
than	1
an	1
artist	1
occupied	1
by	1
his	1
favourite	1
employment	1
every	1
night	1
i	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
a	1
slow	1
fever	1
and	1
i	1
became	1
nervous	1
to	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
degree	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
leaf	1
startled	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
shunned	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
sometimes	1
i	1
grew	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
wreck	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
my	1
purpose	1
alone	1
sustained	1
me	1
my	1
labours	1
would	1
soon	1
end	1
and	1
i	1
believed	1
that	1
exercise	1
and	1
amusement	1
would	1
then	1
drive	1
away	1
incipient	1
disease	1
and	1
i	1
promised	1
myself	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
when	1
my	1
creation	1
should	1
be	1
complete	1
chapter	1
5	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
dreary	1
night	1
of	1
november	1
that	1
i	1
beheld	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
my	1
toils	1
with	1
an	1
anxiety	1
that	1
almost	1
amounted	1
to	1
agony	1
i	1
collected	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
life	1
around	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
infuse	1
a	1
spark	1
of	1
being	1
into	1
the	1
lifeless	1
thing	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
rain	1
pattered	1
dismally	1
against	1
the	1
panes	1
and	1
my	1
candle	1
was	1
nearly	1
burnt	1
out	1
when	1
by	1
the	1
glimmer	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
extinguished	1
light	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
dull	1
yellow	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
open	1
it	1
breathed	1
hard	1
and	1
a	1
convulsive	1
motion	1
agitated	1
its	1
limbs	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
describe	1
my	1
emotions	1
at	1
this	1
catastrophe	1
or	1
how	1
delineate	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
with	1
such	1
infinite	1
pains	1
and	1
care	1
i	1
had	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
form	1
his	1
limbs	1
were	1
in	1
proportion	1
and	1
i	1
had	1
selected	1
his	1
features	1
as	1
beautiful	1
beautiful	1
great	1
god	1
his	1
yellow	1
skin	1
scarcely	1
covered	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
muscles	1
and	1
arteries	1
beneath	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
lustrous	1
black	1
and	1
flowing	1
his	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
pearly	1
whiteness	1
but	1
these	1
luxuriances	1
only	1
formed	1
a	1
more	1
horrid	1
contrast	1
with	1
his	1
watery	1
eyes	1
that	1
seemed	1
almost	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
colour	1
as	1
the	1
dun	1
white	1
sockets	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
set	1
his	1
shrivelled	1
complexion	1
and	1
straight	1
black	1
lips	1
the	1
different	1
accidents	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
changeable	1
as	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
i	1
had	1
worked	1
hard	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
purpose	1
of	1
infusing	1
life	1
into	1
an	1
inanimate	1
body	1
for	1
this	1
i	1
had	1
deprived	1
myself	1
of	1
rest	1
and	1
health	1
i	1
had	1
desired	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
ardour	1
that	1
far	1
exceeded	1
moderation	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
dream	1
vanished	1
and	1
breathless	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
filled	1
my	1
heart	1
unable	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
being	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
i	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
continued	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
traversing	1
my	1
bed	1
chamber	1
unable	1
to	1
compose	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
sleep	1
at	1
length	1
lassitude	1
succeeded	1
to	1
the	1
tumult	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
endured	1
and	1
i	1
threw	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
my	1
clothes	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
of	1
forgetfulness	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
i	1
slept	1
indeed	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
wildest	1
dreams	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
saw	1
elizabeth	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
health	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
ingolstadt	1
delighted	1
and	1
surprised	1
i	1
embraced	1
her	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
imprinted	1
the	1
first	1
kiss	1
on	1
her	1
lips	1
they	1
became	1
livid	1
with	1
the	1
hue	1
of	1
death	1
her	1
features	1
appeared	1
to	1
change	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
i	1
held	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
dead	1
mother	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
a	1
shroud	1
enveloped	1
her	1
form	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
grave	1
worms	1
crawling	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
the	1
flannel	1
i	1
started	1
from	1
my	1
sleep	1
with	1
horror	1
a	1
cold	1
dew	1
covered	1
my	1
forehead	1
my	1
teeth	1
chattered	1
and	1
every	1
limb	1
became	1
convulsed	1
when	1
by	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
yellow	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
as	1
it	1
forced	1
its	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
shutters	1
i	1
beheld	1
the	1
wretch	1
the	1
miserable	1
monster	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
if	1
eyes	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
me	1
his	1
jaws	1
opened	1
and	1
he	1
muttered	1
some	1
inarticulate	1
sounds	1
while	1
a	1
grin	1
wrinkled	1
his	1
cheeks	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
spoken	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
one	1
hand	1
was	1
stretched	1
out	1
seemingly	1
to	1
detain	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
escaped	1
and	1
rushed	1
downstairs	1
i	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
i	1
inhabited	1
where	1
i	1
remained	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
agitation	1
listening	1
attentively	1
catching	1
and	1
fearing	1
each	1
sound	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
demoniacal	1
corpse	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
miserably	1
given	1
life	1
oh	1
no	1
mortal	1
could	1
support	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
that	1
countenance	1
a	1
mummy	1
again	1
endued	1
with	1
animation	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
hideous	1
as	1
that	1
wretch	1
i	1
had	1
gazed	1
on	1
him	1
while	1
unfinished	1
he	1
was	1
ugly	1
then	1
but	1
when	1
those	1
muscles	1
and	1
joints	1
were	1
rendered	1
capable	1
of	1
motion	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
thing	1
such	1
as	1
even	1
dante	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
conceived	1
i	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
wretchedly	1
sometimes	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
so	1
quickly	1
and	1
hardly	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
palpitation	1
of	1
every	1
artery	1
at	1
others	1
i	1
nearly	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
through	1
languor	1
and	1
extreme	1
weakness	1
mingled	1
with	1
this	1
horror	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
disappointment	1
dreams	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
food	1
and	1
pleasant	1
rest	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
space	1
were	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
hell	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
was	1
so	1
rapid	1
the	1
overthrow	1
so	1
complete	1
morning	1
dismal	1
and	1
wet	1
at	1
length	1
dawned	1
and	1
discovered	1
to	1
my	1
sleepless	1
and	1
aching	1
eyes	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
ingolstadt	1
its	1
white	1
steeple	1
and	1
clock	1
which	1
indicated	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
the	1
porter	1
opened	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
had	1
that	1
night	1
been	1
my	1
asylum	1
and	1
i	1
issued	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
pacing	1
them	1
with	1
quick	1
steps	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
sought	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
i	1
feared	1
every	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
would	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
view	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
apartment	1
which	1
i	1
inhabited	1
but	1
felt	1
impelled	1
to	1
hurry	1
on	1
although	1
drenched	1
by	1
the	1
rain	1
which	1
poured	1
from	1
a	1
black	1
and	1
comfortless	1
sky	1
i	1
continued	1
walking	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
endeavouring	1
by	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
to	1
ease	1
the	1
load	1
that	1
weighed	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
i	1
traversed	1
the	1
streets	1
without	1
any	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
or	1
what	1
i	1
was	1
doing	1
my	1
heart	1
palpitated	1
in	1
the	1
sickness	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
i	1
hurried	1
on	1
with	1
irregular	1
steps	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
me	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
on	1
a	1
lonely	1
road	1
doth	1
walk	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
dread	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
turned	1
round	1
walks	1
on	1
and	1
turns	1
no	1
more	1
his	1
head	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
a	1
frightful	1
fiend	1
doth	1
close	1
behind	1
him	1
tread	1
coleridge	1
s	1
ancient	1
mariner	1
continuing	1
thus	1
i	1
came	1
at	1
length	1
opposite	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
various	1
diligences	1
and	1
carriages	1
usually	1
stopped	1
here	1
i	1
paused	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
why	1
but	1
i	1
remained	1
some	1
minutes	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
coach	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
towards	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
as	1
it	1
drew	1
nearer	1
i	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
swiss	1
diligence	1
it	1
stopped	1
just	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
being	1
opened	1
i	1
perceived	1
henry	1
clerval	1
who	1
on	1
seeing	1
me	1
instantly	1
sprung	1
out	1
my	1
dear	1
frankenstein	1
exclaimed	1
he	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
how	1
fortunate	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
here	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
of	1
my	1
alighting	1
nothing	1
could	1
equal	1
my	1
delight	1
on	1
seeing	1
clerval	1
his	1
presence	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
thoughts	1
my	1
father	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
scenes	1
of	1
home	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
i	1
grasped	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
forgot	1
my	1
horror	1
and	1
misfortune	1
i	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
many	1
months	1
calm	1
and	1
serene	1
joy	1
i	1
welcomed	1
my	1
friend	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
cordial	1
manner	1
and	1
we	1
walked	1
towards	1
my	1
college	1
clerval	1
continued	1
talking	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
about	1
our	1
mutual	1
friends	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
being	1
permitted	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
ingolstadt	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
believe	1
said	1
he	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
difficulty	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
all	1
necessary	1
knowledge	1
was	1
not	1
comprised	1
in	1
the	1
noble	1
art	1
of	1
book	1
keeping	1
and	1
indeed	1
i	1
believe	1
i	1
left	1
him	1
incredulous	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
for	1
his	1
constant	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
unwearied	1
entreaties	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
dutch	1
schoolmaster	1
in	1
the	1
vicar	1
of	1
wakefield	1
i	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
florins	1
a	1
year	1
without	1
greek	1
i	1
eat	1
heartily	1
without	1
greek	1
but	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
length	1
overcame	1
his	1
dislike	1
of	1
learning	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
permitted	1
me	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
voyage	1
of	1
discovery	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
knowledge	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
left	1
my	1
father	1
brothers	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
very	1
happy	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy	1
that	1
they	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
so	1
seldom	1
by	1
the	1
by	1
i	1
mean	1
to	1
lecture	1
you	1
a	1
little	1
upon	1
their	1
account	1
myself	1
but	1
my	1
dear	1
frankenstein	1
continued	1
he	1
stopping	1
short	1
and	1
gazing	1
full	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
before	1
remark	1
how	1
very	1
ill	1
you	1
appear	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
pale	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
for	1
several	1
nights	1
you	1
have	1
guessed	1
right	1
i	1
have	1
lately	1
been	1
so	1
deeply	1
engaged	1
in	1
one	1
occupation	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
not	1
allowed	1
myself	1
sufficient	1
rest	1
as	1
you	1
see	1
but	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
employments	1
are	1
now	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
at	1
length	1
free	1
i	1
trembled	1
excessively	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
and	1
far	1
less	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
i	1
walked	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
pace	1
and	1
we	1
soon	1
arrived	1
at	1
my	1
college	1
i	1
then	1
reflected	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
made	1
me	1
shiver	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
apartment	1
might	1
still	1
be	1
there	1
alive	1
and	1
walking	1
about	1
i	1
dreaded	1
to	1
behold	1
this	1
monster	1
but	1
i	1
feared	1
still	1
more	1
that	1
henry	1
should	1
see	1
him	1
entreating	1
him	1
therefore	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
stairs	1
i	1
darted	1
up	1
towards	1
my	1
own	1
room	1
my	1
hand	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
lock	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
i	1
recollected	1
myself	1
i	1
then	1
paused	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
shivering	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
i	1
threw	1
the	1
door	1
forcibly	1
open	1
as	1
children	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
expect	1
a	1
spectre	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
but	1
nothing	1
appeared	1
i	1
stepped	1
fearfully	1
in	1
the	1
apartment	1
was	1
empty	1
and	1
my	1
bedroom	1
was	1
also	1
freed	1
from	1
its	1
hideous	1
guest	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
good	1
fortune	1
could	1
have	1
befallen	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
became	1
assured	1
that	1
my	1
enemy	1
had	1
indeed	1
fled	1
i	1
clapped	1
my	1
hands	1
for	1
joy	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
to	1
clerval	1
we	1
ascended	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
presently	1
brought	1
breakfast	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
contain	1
myself	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
joy	1
only	1
that	1
possessed	1
me	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
flesh	1
tingle	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
sensitiveness	1
and	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
rapidly	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
i	1
jumped	1
over	1
the	1
chairs	1
clapped	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
laughed	1
aloud	1
clerval	1
at	1
first	1
attributed	1
my	1
unusual	1
spirits	1
to	1
joy	1
on	1
his	1
arrival	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
observed	1
me	1
more	1
attentively	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
wildness	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
account	1
and	1
my	1
loud	1
unrestrained	1
heartless	1
laughter	1
frightened	1
and	1
astonished	1
him	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
cried	1
he	1
what	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
do	1
not	1
laugh	1
in	1
that	1
manner	1
how	1
ill	1
you	1
are	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
do	1
not	1
ask	1
me	1
cried	1
i	1
putting	1
my	1
hands	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
i	1
thought	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
dreaded	1
spectre	1
glide	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
can	1
tell	1
oh	1
save	1
me	1
save	1
me	1
i	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
seized	1
me	1
i	1
struggled	1
furiously	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
poor	1
clerval	1
what	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
feelings	1
a	1
meeting	1
which	1
he	1
anticipated	1
with	1
such	1
joy	1
so	1
strangely	1
turned	1
to	1
bitterness	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
his	1
grief	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
lifeless	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
recover	1
my	1
senses	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
long	1
time	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
a	1
nervous	1
fever	1
which	1
confined	1
me	1
for	1
several	1
months	1
during	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
henry	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
nurse	1
i	1
afterwards	1
learned	1
that	1
knowing	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
advanced	1
age	1
and	1
unfitness	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
how	1
wretched	1
my	1
sickness	1
would	1
make	1
elizabeth	1
he	1
spared	1
them	1
this	1
grief	1
by	1
concealing	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
my	1
disorder	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
kind	1
and	1
attentive	1
nurse	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
he	1
felt	1
of	1
my	1
recovery	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
harm	1
he	1
performed	1
the	1
kindest	1
action	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
towards	1
them	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
surely	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
unbounded	1
and	1
unremitting	1
attentions	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
could	1
have	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
on	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
bestowed	1
existence	1
was	1
forever	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
i	1
raved	1
incessantly	1
concerning	1
him	1
doubtless	1
my	1
words	1
surprised	1
henry	1
he	1
at	1
first	1
believed	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wanderings	1
of	1
my	1
disturbed	1
imagination	1
but	1
the	1
pertinacity	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
continually	1
recurred	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
persuaded	1
him	1
that	1
my	1
disorder	1
indeed	1
owed	1
its	1
origin	1
to	1
some	1
uncommon	1
and	1
terrible	1
event	1
by	1
very	1
slow	1
degrees	1
and	1
with	1
frequent	1
relapses	1
that	1
alarmed	1
and	1
grieved	1
my	1
friend	1
i	1
recovered	1
i	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
i	1
became	1
capable	1
of	1
observing	1
outward	1
objects	1
with	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
fallen	1
leaves	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
buds	1
were	1
shooting	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
shaded	1
my	1
window	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
divine	1
spring	1
and	1
the	1
season	1
contributed	1
greatly	1
to	1
my	1
convalescence	1
i	1
felt	1
also	1
sentiments	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
affection	1
revive	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
my	1
gloom	1
disappeared	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
i	1
became	1
as	1
cheerful	1
as	1
before	1
i	1
was	1
attacked	1
by	1
the	1
fatal	1
passion	1
dearest	1
clerval	1
exclaimed	1
i	1
how	1
kind	1
how	1
very	1
good	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
whole	1
winter	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
spent	1
in	1
study	1
as	1
you	1
promised	1
yourself	1
has	1
been	1
consumed	1
in	1
my	1
sick	1
room	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
ever	1
repay	1
you	1
i	1
feel	1
the	1
greatest	1
remorse	1
for	1
the	1
disappointment	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
occasion	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
forgive	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
repay	1
me	1
entirely	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
discompose	1
yourself	1
but	1
get	1
well	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
appear	1
in	1
such	1
good	1
spirits	1
i	1
may	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
one	1
subject	1
may	1
i	1
not	1
i	1
trembled	1
one	1
subject	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
could	1
he	1
allude	1
to	1
an	1
object	1
on	1
whom	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
think	1
compose	1
yourself	1
said	1
clerval	1
who	1
observed	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
colour	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
agitates	1
you	1
but	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
cousin	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
if	1
they	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
handwriting	1
they	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
ill	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
and	1
are	1
uneasy	1
at	1
your	1
long	1
silence	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
dear	1
henry	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
my	1
first	1
thought	1
would	1
not	1
fly	1
towards	1
those	1
dear	1
dear	1
friends	1
whom	1
i	1
love	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
deserving	1
of	1
my	1
love	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
present	1
temper	1
my	1
friend	1
you	1
will	1
perhaps	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
letter	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
lying	1
here	1
some	1
days	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
your	1
cousin	1
i	1
believe	1
chapter	1
6	1
clerval	1
then	1
put	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
dearest	1
cousin	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
ill	1
very	1
ill	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
constant	1
letters	1
of	1
dear	1
kind	1
henry	1
are	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
reassure	1
me	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
you	1
are	1
forbidden	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
pen	1
yet	1
one	1
word	1
from	1
you	1
dear	1
victor	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
calm	1
our	1
apprehensions	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
i	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
each	1
post	1
would	1
bring	1
this	1
line	1
and	1
my	1
persuasions	1
have	1
restrained	1
my	1
uncle	1
from	1
undertaking	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
ingolstadt	1
i	1
have	1
prevented	1
his	1
encountering	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
and	1
perhaps	1
dangers	1
of	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
journey	1
yet	1
how	1
often	1
have	1
i	1
regretted	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
perform	1
it	1
myself	1
i	1
figure	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
attending	1
on	1
your	1
sickbed	1
has	1
devolved	1
on	1
some	1
mercenary	1
old	1
nurse	1
who	1
could	1
never	1
guess	1
your	1
wishes	1
nor	1
minister	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
affection	1
of	1
your	1
poor	1
cousin	1
yet	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
now	1
clerval	1
writes	1
that	1
indeed	1
you	1
are	1
getting	1
better	1
i	1
eagerly	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
confirm	1
this	1
intelligence	1
soon	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
handwriting	1
get	1
well	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
us	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
happy	1
cheerful	1
home	1
and	1
friends	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
dearly	1
your	1
father	1
s	1
health	1
is	1
vigorous	1
and	1
he	1
asks	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
care	1
will	1
ever	1
cloud	1
his	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
how	1
pleased	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
remark	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
our	1
ernest	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
sixteen	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
activity	1
and	1
spirit	1
he	1
is	1
desirous	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
swiss	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
foreign	1
service	1
but	1
we	1
cannot	1
part	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
least	1
until	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
returns	1
to	1
us	1
my	1
uncle	1
is	1
not	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
career	1
in	1
a	1
distant	1
country	1
but	1
ernest	1
never	1
had	1
your	1
powers	1
of	1
application	1
he	1
looks	1
upon	1
study	1
as	1
an	1
odious	1
fetter	1
his	1
time	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
climbing	1
the	1
hills	1
or	1
rowing	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
become	1
an	1
idler	1
unless	1
we	1
yield	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
profession	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
selected	1
little	1
alteration	1
except	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
children	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
since	1
you	1
left	1
us	1
the	1
blue	1
lake	1
and	1
snow	1
clad	1
mountains	1
they	1
never	1
change	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
our	1
placid	1
home	1
and	1
our	1
contented	1
hearts	1
are	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
immutable	1
laws	1
my	1
trifling	1
occupations	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
time	1
and	1
amuse	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
rewarded	1
for	1
any	1
exertions	1
by	1
seeing	1
none	1
but	1
happy	1
kind	1
faces	1
around	1
me	1
since	1
you	1
left	1
us	1
but	1
one	1
change	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
our	1
little	1
household	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
on	1
what	1
occasion	1
justine	1
moritz	1
entered	1
our	1
family	1
probably	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
i	1
will	1
relate	1
her	1
history	1
therefore	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
madame	1
moritz	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
with	1
four	1
children	1
of	1
whom	1
justine	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
this	1
girl	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
but	1
through	1
a	1
strange	1
perversity	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
her	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
m	1
moritz	1
treated	1
her	1
very	1
ill	1
my	1
aunt	1
observed	1
this	1
and	1
when	1
justine	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
prevailed	1
on	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
our	1
house	1
the	1
republican	1
institutions	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
have	1
produced	1
simpler	1
and	1
happier	1
manners	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
monarchies	1
that	1
surround	1
it	1
hence	1
there	1
is	1
less	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
several	1
classes	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
the	1
lower	1
orders	1
being	1
neither	1
so	1
poor	1
nor	1
so	1

in	1

thus	1
received	1
in	1

the	1

of	1
a	1

a	1
condition	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
fortunate	1

does	1
not	1
include	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1

the	1
dignity	1
of	1
a	1
human	1

you	1
may	1

was	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
of	1
yours	1
and	1
i	1
recollect	1
you	1
once	1
remarked	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
ill	1
humour	1
one	1
glance	1
from	1
justine	1
could	1
dissipate	1
it	1
for	1
the	1

reason	1
that	1

beauty	1
of	1
angelica	1
she	1
looked	1
so	1
frank	1
hearted	1
and	1
happy	1
my	1
aunt	1
conceived	1
a	1
great	1
attachment	1
for	1
her	1
by	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
induced	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
an	1
education	1
superior	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
intended	1
this	1
benefit	1
was	1
fully	1
repaid	1
justine	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
grateful	1
little	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
any	1
professions	1
i	1
never	1
heard	1
one	1
pass	1
her	1
lips	1
but	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
she	1
almost	1
adored	1
her	1
protectress	1
although	1
her	1
disposition	1
was	1
gay	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
respects	1
inconsiderate	1
yet	1
she	1
paid	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
to	1
every	1
gesture	1
of	1
my	1
aunt	1
she	1
thought	1
her	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
all	1
excellence	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
imitate	1
her	1
phraseology	1
and	1
manners	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
she	1
often	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
when	1
my	1
dearest	1
aunt	1
died	1
every	1
one	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
occupied	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
grief	1
to	1
notice	1
poor	1
justine	1
who	1
had	1
attended	1
her	1
during	1
her	1
illness	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
affection	1
poor	1
justine	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1

were	1
reserved	1
for	1

childless	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
troubled	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
favourites	1
was	1
a	1
judgement	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
chastise	1
her	1
partiality	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
roman	1
catholic	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
her	1
confessor	1
confirmed	1
the	1
idea	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
conceived	1
accordingly	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
after	1
your	1
departure	1
for	1
ingolstadt	1

repentant	1
mother	1

wept	1
when	1
she	1

was	1
much	1
altered	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
aunt	1

given	1
softness	1
and	1
a	1
winning	1
mildness	1
to	1
her	1
manners	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
remarkable	1
for	1
vivacity	1

was	1
her	1
residence	1
at	1
her	1

of	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
gaiety	1
the	1
poor	1
woman	1
was	1
very	1
vacillating	1
in	1
her	1
repentance	1
she	1
sometimes	1
begged	1
justine	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
unkindness	1
but	1
much	1
oftener	1
accused	1
her	1
of	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sister	1
perpetual	1
fretting	1
at	1
length	1
threw	1
madame	1

into	1
a	1
decline	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
increased	1
her	1
irritability	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
at	1
peace	1
for	1
ever	1

died	1
on	1

dear	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
her	1
letter	1
i	1
will	1
write	1
instantly	1
and	1
relieve	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
anxiety	1
they	1
must	1
feel	1
i	1
wrote	1
and	1
this	1
exertion	1
greatly	1
fatigued	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
convalescence	1
had	1
commenced	1
and	1
proceeded	1
regularly	1
in	1
another	1
fortnight	1
i	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
chamber	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
first	1
duties	1
on	1
my	1
recovery	1
was	1
to	1
introduce	1
clerval	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
professors	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
i	1
underwent	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
rough	1
usage	1
ill	1
befitting	1
the	1
wounds	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
had	1
sustained	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
fatal	1
night	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
i	1
had	1
conceived	1
a	1
violent	1
antipathy	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
natural	1
philosophy	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
otherwise	1
quite	1
restored	1
to	1
health	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
chemical	1
instrument	1
would	1
renew	1
all	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
nervous	1
symptoms	1
henry	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
had	1
removed	1
all	1
my	1
apparatus	1
from	1
my	1
view	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
changed	1
my	1
apartment	1
for	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
dislike	1
for	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
previously	1
been	1
my	1
laboratory	1
but	1
these	1
cares	1
of	1
clerval	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
when	1
i	1
visited	1
the	1
professors	1
m	1
waldman	1
inflicted	1
torture	1
when	1
he	1
praised	1
with	1
kindness	1
and	1
warmth	1
the	1
astonishing	1
progress	1
i	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
sciences	1
he	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
i	1
disliked	1
the	1
subject	1
but	1
not	1
guessing	1
the	1
real	1
cause	1
he	1
attributed	1
my	1
feelings	1
to	1
modesty	1
and	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
from	1
my	1
improvement	1
to	1
the	1
science	1
itself	1
with	1
a	1
desire	1
as	1
i	1
evidently	1
saw	1
of	1
drawing	1
me	1
out	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
do	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
please	1
and	1
he	1
tormented	1
me	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
carefully	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
in	1
my	1
view	1
those	1
instruments	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
afterwards	1
used	1
in	1
putting	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
cruel	1
death	1
i	1
writhed	1
under	1
his	1
words	1
yet	1
dared	1
not	1
exhibit	1
the	1
pain	1
i	1
felt	1
clerval	1
whose	1
eyes	1
and	1
feelings	1
were	1
always	1
quick	1
in	1
discerning	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
others	1
declined	1
the	1
subject	1
alleging	1
in	1
excuse	1
his	1
total	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
took	1
a	1
more	1
general	1
turn	1
i	1
thanked	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
i	1
saw	1
plainly	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
attempted	1
to	1
draw	1
my	1
secret	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
although	1
i	1
loved	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
reverence	1
that	1
knew	1
no	1
bounds	1
yet	1
i	1
could	1
never	1
persuade	1
myself	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
event	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
often	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
but	1
which	1
i	1
feared	1
the	1
detail	1
to	1
another	1
would	1
only	1
impress	1
more	1
deeply	1
m	1
krempe	1
was	1
not	1
equally	1
docile	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
condition	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
almost	1
insupportable	1
sensitiveness	1
his	1
harsh	1
blunt	1
encomiums	1
gave	1
me	1
even	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
the	1
benevolent	1
approbation	1
of	1
m	1
waldman	1
d	1
n	1
the	1
fellow	1
cried	1
he	1
why	1
m	1
clerval	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
has	1
outstript	1
us	1
all	1
ay	1
stare	1
if	1
you	1
please	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
nevertheless	1
true	1
a	1
youngster	1
who	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
believed	1
in	1
cornelius	1
agrippa	1
as	1
firmly	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
has	1
now	1
set	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
soon	1
pulled	1
down	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
ay	1
ay	1
continued	1
he	1
observing	1
my	1
face	1
expressive	1
of	1
suffering	1
m	1
frankenstein	1
is	1
modest	1
an	1
excellent	1
quality	1
in	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
young	1

should	1
be	1
diffident	1
of	1
themselves	1
you	1
know	1
m	1
clerval	1
i	1
was	1
myself	1
when	1
young	1
but	1
that	1
wears	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
m	1
krempe	1
had	1
now	1
commenced	1
an	1
eulogy	1
on	1
himself	1
which	1
happily	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
from	1
a	1
subject	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
annoying	1
to	1
me	1
clerval	1
had	1
never	1
sympathized	1
in	1
my	1
tastes	1
for	1
natural	1
science	1
and	1
his	1
literary	1
pursuits	1
differed	1
wholly	1
from	1
those	1
which	1
had	1
occupied	1
me	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
university	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
making	1
himself	1
complete	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
oriental	1
languages	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
should	1
open	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
himself	1
resolved	1
to	1
pursue	1
no	1
inglorious	1
career	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
as	1
affording	1
scope	1
for	1
his	1
spirit	1
of	1
enterprise	1
the	1
persian	1
arabic	1
and	1
sanskrit	1
languages	1
engaged	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
easily	1
induced	1
to	1
enter	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
studies	1
idleness	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
reflection	1
and	1
hated	1
my	1
former	1
studies	1
i	1
felt	1
great	1
relief	1
in	1
being	1
the	1
fellow	1
pupil	1
with	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
only	1
instruction	1
but	1
consolation	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
orientalists	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
him	1
attempt	1
a	1
critical	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
dialects	1
for	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
contemplate	1
making	1
any	1
other	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
temporary	1
amusement	1
i	1
read	1
merely	1
to	1
understand	1
their	1
meaning	1
and	1
they	1
well	1
repaid	1
my	1
labours	1
their	1
melancholy	1
is	1
soothing	1
and	1
their	1
joy	1
elevating	1
to	1
a	1
degree	1
i	1
never	1
experienced	1
in	1
studying	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
country	1
when	1
you	1
read	1
their	1
writings	1
life	1
appears	1
to	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
warm	1
sun	1
and	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
roses	1
in	1
the	1
smiles	1
and	1
frowns	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
enemy	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
consumes	1
your	1
own	1
heart	1
how	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
manly	1
and	1
heroical	1
poetry	1
of	1
greece	1
and	1
rome	1
summer	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
these	1
occupations	1
and	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
geneva	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
autumn	1
but	1
being	1
delayed	1
by	1
several	1
accidents	1
winter	1
and	1
snow	1
arrived	1
the	1
roads	1
were	1
deemed	1
impassable	1
and	1
my	1
journey	1
was	1
retarded	1
until	1
the	1
ensuing	1
spring	1
i	1
felt	1
this	1
delay	1
very	1
bitterly	1
for	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
friends	1
my	1
return	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
delayed	1
so	1
long	1
from	1
an	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
leave	1
clerval	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
place	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
the	1
winter	1
however	1
was	1
spent	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
spring	1
was	1
uncommonly	1
late	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
its	1
beauty	1
compensated	1
for	1
its	1
dilatoriness	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
may	1
had	1
already	1
commenced	1
and	1
i	1
expected	1
the	1
letter	1
daily	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
when	1
henry	1
proposed	1
a	1
pedestrian	1
tour	1
in	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
ingolstadt	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
bid	1
a	1
personal	1
farewell	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
inhabited	1
i	1
acceded	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
this	1
proposition	1
i	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
exercise	1
and	1
clerval	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
my	1
favourite	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
ramble	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
taken	1
among	1
the	1
scenes	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
we	1
passed	1
a	1
fortnight	1
in	1
these	1
perambulations	1
my	1
health	1
and	1
spirits	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
restored	1
and	1
they	1
gained	1
additional	1
strength	1
from	1
the	1
salubrious	1
air	1
i	1
breathed	1
the	1
natural	1
incidents	1
of	1
our	1
progress	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
study	1
had	1
before	1
secluded	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
intercourse	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
and	1
rendered	1
me	1
unsocial	1
but	1
clerval	1
called	1
forth	1
the	1
better	1
feelings	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
he	1
again	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
the	1
cheerful	1
faces	1
of	1
children	1
excellent	1
friend	1
how	1
sincerely	1
you	1
did	1
love	1
me	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
elevate	1
my	1
mind	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
a	1
selfish	1
pursuit	1
had	1
cramped	1
and	1
narrowed	1
me	1
until	1
your	1
gentleness	1
and	1
affection	1
warmed	1
and	1
opened	1
my	1
senses	1
i	1
became	1
the	1
same	1
happy	1
creature	1
who	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
loved	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
had	1
no	1
sorrow	1
or	1
care	1
when	1
happy	1
inanimate	1
nature	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
bestowing	1
on	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
sensations	1
a	1
serene	1
sky	1
and	1
verdant	1
fields	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
ecstasy	1
the	1
present	1
season	1
was	1
indeed	1
divine	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
spring	1
bloomed	1
in	1
the	1
hedges	1
while	1
those	1
of	1
summer	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
bud	1
i	1
was	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
thoughts	1
which	1
during	1
the	1
preceding	1
year	1
had	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
notwithstanding	1
my	1
endeavours	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
off	1
with	1
an	1
invincible	1
burden	1
henry	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
my	1
gaiety	1
and	1
sincerely	1
sympathised	1
in	1
my	1
feelings	1
he	1
exerted	1
himself	1
to	1
amuse	1
me	1
while	1
he	1
expressed	1
the	1
sensations	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
soul	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
were	1
truly	1
astonishing	1
his	1
conversation	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
imagination	1
and	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
persian	1
and	1
arabic	1
writers	1
he	1
invented	1
tales	1
of	1
wonderful	1
fancy	1
and	1
passion	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
repeated	1
my	1
favourite	1
poems	1
or	1
drew	1
me	1
out	1
into	1
arguments	1
which	1
he	1
supported	1
with	1
great	1
ingenuity	1
we	1
returned	1
to	1
our	1
college	1
on	1
a	1
sunday	1
afternoon	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
dancing	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
we	1
met	1
appeared	1
gay	1
and	1
happy	1
my	1
own	1
spirits	1
were	1
high	1
and	1
i	1
bounded	1
along	1
with	1
feelings	1
of	1
unbridled	1
joy	1
and	1
hilarity	1
chapter	1
7	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
you	1
have	1
probably	1
waited	1
impatiently	1
for	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
your	1
return	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
tempted	1
to	1
write	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
merely	1
mentioning	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
expect	1
you	1
but	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
cruel	1
kindness	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
your	1
surprise	1
my	1
son	1
when	1
you	1
expected	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
glad	1
welcome	1
to	1
behold	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
tears	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
how	1
victor	1
can	1
i	1
relate	1
our	1
misfortune	1
absence	1
cannot	1
have	1
rendered	1
you	1
callous	1
to	1
our	1
joys	1
and	1
griefs	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
inflict	1
pain	1
on	1
my	1
long	1
absent	1
son	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
prepare	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
woeful	1
news	1
but	1
i	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
even	1
now	1
your	1
eye	1
skims	1
over	1
the	1
page	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
convey	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
horrible	1
tidings	1
william	1
is	1
dead	1
that	1
sweet	1
child	1
whose	1
smiles	1
delighted	1
and	1
warmed	1
my	1
heart	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
gentle	1
yet	1
so	1
gay	1
victor	1
he	1
is	1
murdered	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
console	1
you	1
but	1
will	1
simply	1
relate	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
transaction	1
last	1
thursday	1
may	1
7th	1
i	1
my	1
niece	1
and	1
your	1
two	1
brothers	1
went	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
plainpalais	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
warm	1
and	1
serene	1
and	1
we	1
prolonged	1
our	1
walk	1
farther	1
than	1
usual	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
dusk	1
before	1
we	1
thought	1
of	1
returning	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
discovered	1
that	1
william	1
and	1
ernest	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
before	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
we	1
accordingly	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
seat	1
until	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
presently	1
ernest	1
came	1
and	1
enquired	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
brother	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
william	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
to	1
hide	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
vainly	1
sought	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
afterwards	1
waited	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
this	1
account	1
rather	1
alarmed	1
us	1
and	1
we	1
continued	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
him	1
until	1
night	1
fell	1
when	1
elizabeth	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
we	1
returned	1
again	1
with	1
torches	1
for	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
rest	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
sweet	1
boy	1
had	1
lost	1
himself	1
and	1
was	1
exposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
damps	1
and	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
elizabeth	1
also	1
suffered	1
extreme	1
anguish	1
about	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
discovered	1
my	1
lovely	1
boy	1
whom	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
blooming	1
and	1
active	1
in	1
health	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
livid	1
and	1
motionless	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
s	1
finger	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
he	1
was	1
conveyed	1
home	1
and	1
the	1
anguish	1
that	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
my	1
countenance	1
betrayed	1
the	1
secret	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
earnest	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
corpse	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
attempted	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
but	1
she	1
persisted	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
it	1
lay	1
hastily	1
examined	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
victim	1
and	1
clasping	1
her	1
hands	1
exclaimed	1
o	1
god	1
i	1
have	1
murdered	1
my	1
darling	1
child	1
she	1
fainted	1
and	1
was	1
restored	1
with	1
extreme	1
difficulty	1
when	1
she	1
again	1
lived	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
sigh	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
that	1
same	1
evening	1
william	1
had	1
teased	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
wear	1
a	1
very	1
valuable	1
miniature	1
that	1
she	1
possessed	1
of	1
your	1
mother	1
this	1
picture	1
is	1
gone	1
and	1
was	1
doubtless	1
the	1
temptation	1
which	1
urged	1
the	1
murderer	1
to	1
the	1
deed	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
present	1
although	1
our	1
exertions	1
to	1
discover	1
him	1
are	1
unremitted	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
restore	1
my	1
beloved	1
william	1
come	1
dearest	1
victor	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
console	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
weeps	1
continually	1
and	1
accuses	1
herself	1
unjustly	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
her	1
words	1
pierce	1
my	1
heart	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
unhappy	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
that	1
be	1
an	1
additional	1
motive	1
for	1
you	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
comforter	1
your	1
dear	1
mother	1
alas	1
victor	1
i	1
now	1
say	1
thank	1
god	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
cruel	1
miserable	1
death	1
of	1
her	1
youngest	1
darling	1
come	1
victor	1
not	1
brooding	1
thoughts	1
of	1
vengeance	1
against	1
the	1
assassin	1
but	1
with	1
feelings	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
gentleness	1
that	1
will	1
heal	1
instead	1
of	1
festering	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
our	1
minds	1
enter	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
my	1
friend	1
but	1
with	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
hatred	1
for	1
your	1
enemies	1

and	1
afflicted	1

clerval	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
my	1
countenance	1
as	1
i	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
despair	1
that	1
succeeded	1
the	1
joy	1
i	1
at	1
first	1
expressed	1
on	1
receiving	1
new	1
from	1
my	1
friends	1
i	1
threw	1
the	1
letter	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
covered	1
my	1
face	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
my	1
dear	1
frankenstein	1
exclaimed	1
henry	1
when	1
he	1
perceived	1
me	1
weep	1
with	1
bitterness	1
are	1
you	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
i	1
motioned	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
letter	1
while	1
i	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
extremest	1
agitation	1
tears	1
also	1
gushed	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
clerval	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune	1
i	1
can	1
offer	1
you	1
no	1
consolation	1
my	1
friend	1
said	1
he	1
your	1
disaster	1
is	1
irreparable	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
go	1
instantly	1
to	1
geneva	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
henry	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
horses	1
during	1
our	1
walk	1
clerval	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
of	1
consolation	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
express	1
his	1
heartfelt	1
sympathy	1
poor	1
william	1
said	1
he	1
dear	1
lovely	1
child	1
he	1
now	1
sleeps	1
with	1
his	1
angel	1
mother	1
who	1
that	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
bright	1
and	1
joyous	1
in	1
his	1
young	1
beauty	1
but	1
must	1
weep	1
over	1
his	1
untimely	1
loss	1
to	1
die	1
so	1
miserably	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
murderer	1
s	1
grasp	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
a	1
murdered	1
that	1
could	1
destroy	1
radiant	1
innocence	1
poor	1
little	1
fellow	1
one	1
only	1
consolation	1
have	1
we	1
his	1
friends	1
mourn	1
and	1
weep	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
rest	1
the	1
pang	1
is	1
over	1
his	1
sufferings	1
are	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
for	1
ever	1
a	1
sod	1
covers	1
his	1
gentle	1
form	1
and	1
he	1
knows	1
no	1
pain	1
he	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
pity	1
we	1
must	1
reserve	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
miserable	1
survivors	1
clerval	1
spoke	1
thus	1
as	1
we	1
hurried	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
the	1
words	1
impressed	1
themselves	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
i	1
remembered	1
them	1
afterwards	1
in	1
solitude	1
but	1
now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
horses	1
arrived	1
i	1
hurried	1
into	1
a	1
cabriolet	1
and	1
bade	1
farewell	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
my	1
journey	1
was	1
very	1
melancholy	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
hurry	1
on	1
for	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
console	1
and	1
sympathise	1
with	1
my	1
loved	1
and	1
sorrowing	1
friends	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
drew	1
near	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
i	1
slackened	1
my	1
progress	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
sustain	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
feelings	1
that	1
crowded	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
i	1
passed	1
through	1
scenes	1
familiar	1
to	1
my	1
youth	1
but	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
nearly	1
six	1
years	1
how	1
altered	1
every	1
thing	1
might	1
be	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
one	1
sudden	1
and	1
desolating	1
change	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
but	1
a	1
thousand	1
little	1
circumstances	1
might	1
have	1
by	1
degrees	1
worked	1
other	1
alterations	1
which	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
done	1
more	1
tranquilly	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
decisive	1
fear	1
overcame	1
me	1
i	1
dared	1
no	1
advance	1
dreading	1
a	1
thousand	1
nameless	1
evils	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
tremble	1
although	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
define	1
them	1
i	1
remained	1
two	1
days	1
at	1
lausanne	1
in	1
this	1
painful	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
i	1
contemplated	1
the	1
lake	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
placid	1
all	1
around	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
the	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
nature	1
were	1
not	1
changed	1
by	1
degrees	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
heavenly	1
scene	1
restored	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
continued	1
my	1
journey	1
towards	1
geneva	1
the	1
road	1
ran	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
became	1
narrower	1
as	1
i	1
approached	1
my	1
native	1
town	1
i	1
discovered	1
more	1
distinctly	1
the	1
black	1
sides	1
of	1
jura	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
summit	1
of	1
mont	1
blanc	1
i	1
wept	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
dear	1
mountains	1
my	1
own	1
beautiful	1
lake	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
welcome	1
your	1
wanderer	1
your	1
summits	1
are	1
clear	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
lake	1
are	1
blue	1
and	1
placid	1
is	1
this	1
to	1
prognosticate	1
peace	1
or	1
to	1
mock	1
at	1
my	1
unhappiness	1
i	1
fear	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
render	1
myself	1
tedious	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
these	1
preliminary	1
circumstances	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
days	1
of	1
comparative	1
happiness	1
and	1
i	1
think	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
my	1
country	1
my	1
beloved	1
country	1
who	1
but	1
a	1
native	1
can	1
tell	1
the	1
delight	1
i	1
took	1
in	1
again	1
beholding	1
thy	1
streams	1
thy	1
mountains	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
thy	1
lovely	1
lake	1
yet	1
as	1
i	1
drew	1
nearer	1
home	1
grief	1
and	1
fear	1
again	1
overcame	1
me	1
night	1
also	1
closed	1
around	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
see	1
the	1
dark	1
mountains	1
i	1
felt	1
still	1
more	1
gloomily	1
the	1
picture	1
appeared	1
a	1
vast	1
and	1
dim	1
scene	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
i	1
foresaw	1
obscurely	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
most	1
wretched	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
alas	1
i	1
prophesied	1
truly	1
and	1
failed	1
only	1
in	1
one	1
single	1
circumstance	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
i	1
imagined	1
and	1
dreaded	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
conceive	1
the	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
anguish	1
i	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
endure	1
it	1
was	1
completely	1
dark	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
in	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
geneva	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
were	1
already	1
shut	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
secheron	1
a	1
village	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
serene	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
rest	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
my	1
poor	1
william	1
had	1
been	1
murdered	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
lake	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
plainpalais	1
during	1
this	1
short	1
voyage	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
lightning	1
playing	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
mont	1
blanc	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
figures	1
the	1
storm	1
appeared	1
to	1
approach	1
rapidly	1
and	1
on	1
landing	1
i	1
ascended	1
a	1
low	1
hill	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
observe	1
its	1
progress	1
it	1
advanced	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
clouded	1
and	1
i	1
soon	1
felt	1
the	1
rain	1
coming	1
slowly	1
in	1
large	1
drops	1
but	1
its	1
violence	1
quickly	1
increased	1
i	1
quitted	1
my	1
seat	1
and	1
walked	1
on	1
although	1
the	1
darkness	1
and	1
storm	1
increased	1
every	1
minute	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
burst	1
with	1
a	1
terrific	1
crash	1
over	1
my	1
head	1
it	1
was	1
echoed	1
from	1
saleve	1
the	1
juras	1
and	1
the	1
alps	1
of	1
savoy	1
vivid	1
flashes	1
of	1
lightning	1
dazzled	1
my	1
eyes	1
illuminating	1
the	1
lake	1
making	1
it	1
appear	1
like	1
a	1
vast	1
sheet	1
of	1
fire	1
then	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
every	1
thing	1
seemed	1
of	1
a	1
pitchy	1
darkness	1
until	1
the	1
eye	1
recovered	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
preceding	1
flash	1
the	1
storm	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
switzerland	1
appeared	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
storm	1
hung	1
exactly	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
over	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
promontory	1
of	1
belrive	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
copet	1
another	1
storm	1
enlightened	1
jura	1
with	1
faint	1
flashes	1
and	1
another	1
darkened	1
and	1
sometimes	1
disclosed	1
the	1
mole	1
a	1
peaked	1
mountain	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
while	1
i	1
watched	1
the	1
tempest	1
so	1
beautiful	1
yet	1
terrific	1
i	1
wandered	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
hasty	1
step	1
this	1
noble	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
elevated	1
my	1
spirits	1
i	1
clasped	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
aloud	1
william	1
dear	1
angel	1
this	1
is	1
thy	1
funeral	1
this	1
thy	1
dirge	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
i	1
perceived	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
a	1
figure	1
which	1
stole	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
near	1
me	1
i	1
stood	1
fixed	1
gazing	1
intently	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
illuminated	1
the	1
object	1
and	1
discovered	1
its	1
shape	1
plainly	1
to	1
me	1
its	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
and	1
the	1
deformity	1
of	1
its	1
aspect	1
more	1
hideous	1
than	1
belongs	1
to	1
humanity	1
instantly	1
informed	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wretch	1
the	1
filthy	1
daemon	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
given	1
life	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
there	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
i	1
shuddered	1
at	1
the	1
conception	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
no	1
sooner	1
did	1
that	1
idea	1
cross	1
my	1
imagination	1
than	1
i	1
became	1
convinced	1
of	1
its	1
truth	1
my	1
teeth	1
chattered	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
lean	1
against	1
a	1
tree	1
for	1
support	1
the	1
figure	1
passed	1
me	1
quickly	1
and	1
i	1
lost	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
nothing	1
in	1
human	1
shape	1
could	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
fair	1
child	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
murderer	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
doubt	1
it	1
the	1
mere	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
idea	1
was	1
an	1
irresistible	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
pursuing	1
the	1
devil	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
another	1
flash	1
discovered	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
hanging	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
nearly	1
perpendicular	1
ascent	1
of	1
mont	1
saleve	1
a	1
hill	1
that	1
bounds	1
plainpalais	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
he	1
soon	1
reached	1
the	1
summit	1
and	1
disappeared	1
i	1
remained	1
motionless	1
the	1
thunder	1
ceased	1
but	1
the	1
rain	1
still	1
continued	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
was	1
enveloped	1
in	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
darkness	1
i	1
revolved	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
until	1
now	1
sought	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
whole	1
train	1
of	1
my	1
progress	1
toward	1
the	1
creation	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
hands	1
at	1
my	1
bedside	1
its	1
departure	1
two	1
years	1
had	1
now	1
nearly	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
first	1
received	1
life	1
and	1
was	1
this	1
his	1
first	1
crime	1
alas	1
i	1
had	1
turned	1
loose	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
depraved	1
wretch	1
whose	1
delight	1
was	1
in	1
carnage	1
and	1
misery	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
murdered	1
my	1
brother	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
conceive	1
the	1
anguish	1
i	1
suffered	1
during	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
which	1
i	1
spent	1
cold	1
and	1
wet	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
busy	1
in	1
scenes	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
despair	1
i	1
considered	1
the	1
being	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
cast	1
among	1
mankind	1
and	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
effect	1
purposes	1
of	1
horror	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
deed	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
done	1
nearly	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
vampire	1
my	1
own	1
spirit	1
let	1
loose	1
from	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
day	1
dawned	1
and	1
i	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
town	1
the	1
gates	1
were	1
open	1
and	1
i	1
hastened	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
my	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
i	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
and	1
cause	1
instant	1
pursuit	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
but	1
i	1
paused	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
story	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
being	1
whom	1
i	1
myself	1
had	1
formed	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
life	1
had	1
met	1
me	1
at	1
midnight	1
among	1
the	1
precipices	1
of	1
an	1
inaccessible	1
mountain	1
i	1
remembered	1
also	1
the	1
nervous	1
fever	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
seized	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
i	1
dated	1
my	1
creation	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
delirium	1
to	1
a	1
tale	1
otherwise	1
so	1
utterly	1
improbable	1
i	1
well	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
had	1
communicated	1
such	1
a	1
relation	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
ravings	1
of	1
insanity	1
besides	1
the	1
strange	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
would	1
elude	1
all	1
pursuit	1
even	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
credited	1
as	1
to	1
persuade	1
my	1
relatives	1
to	1
commence	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
what	1
use	1
would	1
be	1
pursuit	1
who	1
could	1
arrest	1
a	1
creature	1
capable	1
of	1
scaling	1
the	1
overhanging	1
sides	1
of	1
mont	1
saleve	1
these	1
reflections	1
determined	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
remain	1
silent	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
i	1
entered	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
i	1
told	1
the	1
servants	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
family	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
attend	1
their	1
usual	1
hour	1
of	1
rising	1
six	1
years	1
had	1
elapsed	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
indelible	1
trace	1
and	1
i	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
last	1
embraced	1
my	1
father	1
before	1
my	1
departure	1
for	1
ingolstadt	1
beloved	1
and	1
venerable	1
parent	1
he	1
still	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
which	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
mantel	1
piece	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
historical	1
subject	1
painted	1
at	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
desire	1
and	1
represented	1
caroline	1
beaufort	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
despair	1
kneeling	1
by	1
the	1
coffin	1
of	1
her	1
dead	1
father	1
her	1
garb	1
was	1
rustic	1
and	1
her	1
cheek	1
pale	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
beauty	1
that	1
hardly	1
permitted	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
pity	1
below	1
this	1
picture	1
was	1
a	1
miniature	1
of	1
william	1
and	1
my	1
tears	1
flowed	1
when	1
i	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
thus	1
engaged	1
ernest	1
entered	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
me	1
arrive	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
welcome	1
me	1
welcome	1
my	1
dearest	1
victor	1
said	1
he	1
ah	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
come	1
three	1
months	1
ago	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
us	1
all	1
joyous	1
and	1
delighted	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
now	1
to	1
share	1
a	1
misery	1
which	1
nothing	1
can	1
alleviate	1
yet	1
your	1
presence	1
will	1
i	1
hope	1
revive	1
our	1
father	1
who	1
seems	1
sinking	1
under	1
his	1
misfortune	1
and	1
your	1
persuasions	1
will	1
induce	1
poor	1
elizabeth	1
to	1
cease	1
her	1
vain	1
and	1
tormenting	1
self	1
accusations	1
poor	1
william	1
he	1
was	1
our	1
darling	1
and	1
our	1
pride	1
tears	1
unrestrained	1
fell	1
from	1
my	1
brother	1
s	1
eyes	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
mortal	1
agony	1
crept	1
over	1
my	1
frame	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
only	1
imagined	1
the	1
wretchedness	1
of	1
my	1
desolated	1
home	1
the	1
reality	1
came	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
a	1
not	1
less	1
terrible	1
disaster	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
calm	1
ernest	1
i	1
enquired	1
more	1
minutely	1
concerning	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
here	1
i	1
named	1
my	1
cousin	1
she	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
said	1
ernest	1
requires	1
consolation	1
she	1
accused	1
herself	1
of	1
having	1
caused	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
very	1
wretched	1
but	1
since	1
the	1
murderer	1
has	1
been	1

several	1
circumstances	1
came	1
out	1
that	1
have	1
almost	1
forced	1
conviction	1
upon	1
us	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
behaviour	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
confused	1
as	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1

a	1
weight	1
that	1
i	1

leaves	1
no	1

all	1
he	1
then	1
related	1
that	1
the	1
morning	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
poor	1
william	1
had	1
been	1
discovered	1
justine	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
ill	1
and	1
confined	1
to	1
her	1
bed	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
during	1
this	1
interval	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
happening	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
apparel	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
discovered	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
judged	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
the	1
servant	1
instantly	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
deposition	1
justine	1
was	1
apprehended	1
on	1
being	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
confirmed	1
the	1
suspicion	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
by	1
her	1
extreme	1
confusion	1
of	1
manner	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
tale	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
shake	1
my	1
faith	1
and	1
i	1
replied	1
earnestly	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
mistaken	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
murderer	1
justine	1
poor	1
good	1
justine	1
is	1
innocent	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
i	1
saw	1
unhappiness	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
countenance	1
but	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
welcome	1
me	1
cheerfully	1
and	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
exchanged	1
our	1
mournful	1
greeting	1
would	1
have	1
introduced	1
some	1
other	1
topic	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
our	1
disaster	1
had	1
not	1
ernest	1
exclaimed	1
good	1
god	1
papa	1
victor	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
poor	1
william	1
we	1
do	1
also	1
unfortunately	1
replied	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
indeed	1
i	1
had	1
rather	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
ever	1
ignorant	1
than	1
have	1
discovered	1
so	1
much	1
depravity	1
and	1
ungratitude	1
in	1
one	1
i	1
valued	1
so	1
highly	1
my	1
dear	1
father	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
justine	1
is	1
innocent	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
god	1
forbid	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
as	1
guilty	1
she	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
today	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
i	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
acquitted	1
this	1
speech	1
calmed	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
justine	1
and	1
indeed	1
every	1
human	1
being	1
was	1
guiltless	1
of	1
this	1
murder	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
fear	1
therefore	1
that	1
any	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
could	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
convict	1
her	1
my	1
tale	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
announce	1
publicly	1
its	1
astounding	1
horror	1
would	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
madness	1
by	1
the	1
vulgar	1
did	1
any	1
one	1
indeed	1
exist	1
except	1
i	1
the	1
creator	1
who	1
would	1
believe	1
unless	1
his	1
senses	1
convinced	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
monument	1
of	1
presumption	1
and	1
rash	1
ignorance	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
we	1
were	1
soon	1
joined	1
by	1
elizabeth	1

had	1
altered	1
her	1
since	1
i	1
last	1
beheld	1
her	1
it	1
had	1
endowed	1
her	1
with	1
loveliness	1
surpassing	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
childish	1
years	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
candour	1
the	1
same	1
vivacity	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
allied	1
to	1
an	1
expression	1
more	1
full	1
of	1
sensibility	1
and	1
intellect	1
she	1
welcomed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
affection	1
your	1
arrival	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin	1
said	1
she	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
hope	1
you	1
perhaps	1
will	1
find	1
some	1
means	1
to	1
justify	1
my	1
poor	1
guiltless	1
justine	1
alas	1
who	1
is	1
safe	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
convicted	1
of	1
crime	1
i	1
rely	1
on	1
her	1
innocence	1
as	1
certainly	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
our	1
misfortune	1
is	1
doubly	1
hard	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
lost	1
that	1
lovely	1
darling	1
boy	1
but	1
this	1
poor	1
girl	1
whom	1
i	1
sincerely	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
torn	1
away	1
by	1
even	1
a	1
worse	1
fate	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
condemned	1
i	1
never	1
shall	1
know	1
joy	1
more	1
but	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
again	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
sad	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
william	1
she	1
is	1
innocent	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
said	1
i	1
and	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
proved	1
fear	1
nothing	1

let	1
your	1
spirits	1
be	1
cheered	1
by	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
acquittal	1
how	1
kind	1
and	1
generous	1
you	1
are	1
every	1
one	1

in	1
her	1
guilt	1
and	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
wretched	1
for	1
i	1

that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
every	1

passed	1
a	1
few	1
sad	1
hours	1
until	1
eleven	1
o	1
clock	1
when	1
the	1
trial	1
was	1
to	1
commence	1
my	1

the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1

being	1
obliged	1
to	1
attend	1
as	1
witnesses	1

accompanied	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
wretched	1
mockery	1
of	1
justice	1
i	1
suffered	1
living	1
torture	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
whether	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
my	1
curiosity	1
and	1
lawless	1
devices	1
would	1
cause	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
beings	1

smiling	1
babe	1
full	1
of	1
innocence	1
and	1
joy	1
the	1
other	1

more	1
dreadfully	1
murdered	1
with	1
every	1
aggravation	1
of	1
infamy	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
murder	1
memorable	1
in	1

justine	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
merit	1
and	1
possessed	1
qualities	1
which	1
promised	1
to	1
render	1
her	1
life	1
happy	1
now	1
all	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
obliterated	1
in	1
an	1
ignominious	1
grave	1
and	1
i	1
the	1
cause	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
rather	1
would	1
i	1
have	1
confessed	1
myself	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
ascribed	1
to	1
justine	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
absent	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
committed	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
declaration	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
ravings	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
exculpated	1
her	1
who	1
suffered	1
through	1
me	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
justine	1
was	1
calm	1
she	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
mourning	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
always	1
engaging	1
was	1
rendered	1
by	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
exquisitely	1
beautiful	1
yet	1
she	1
appeared	1
confident	1
in	1
innocence	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
tremble	1
although	1
gazed	1
on	1
and	1
execrated	1
by	1
thousands	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
kindness	1
which	1
her	1
beauty	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
excited	1
was	1
obliterated	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
spectators	1
by	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
enormity	1
she	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
committed	1
she	1
was	1
tranquil	1
yet	1
her	1
tranquillity	1
was	1
evidently	1
constrained	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
confusion	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
adduced	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
guilt	1
she	1
worked	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
courage	1
when	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
court	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
eyes	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
quickly	1
discovered	1
where	1
we	1
were	1
seated	1
a	1
tear	1
seemed	1
to	1
dim	1
her	1
eye	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
us	1
but	1
she	1
quickly	1
recovered	1
herself	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
sorrowful	1
affection	1
seemed	1
to	1
attest	1
her	1
utter	1
guiltlessness	1
the	1
trial	1
began	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
advocate	1
against	1
her	1
had	1
stated	1
the	1
charge	1
several	1
witnesses	1
were	1
called	1
several	1
strange	1
facts	1
combined	1
against	1
her	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
staggered	1
anyone	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
such	1
proof	1
of	1
her	1
innocence	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
committed	1
and	1
towards	1
morning	1
had	1
been	1
perceived	1
by	1
a	1
market	1
woman	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
afterwards	1
found	1
the	1
woman	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
there	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
very	1
strangely	1
and	1
only	1
returned	1
a	1
confused	1
and	1
unintelligible	1
answer	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
eight	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
when	1
one	1
inquired	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
demanded	1
earnestly	1
if	1
anything	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
concerning	1
him	1
when	1
shown	1
the	1
body	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
violent	1
hysterics	1
and	1
kept	1
her	1
bed	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
the	1
picture	1
was	1
then	1
produced	1
which	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
pocket	1
and	1
when	1
elizabeth	1
in	1
a	1
faltering	1
voice	1
proved	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
missed	1
she	1
had	1
placed	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
indignation	1
filled	1
the	1
court	1
justine	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
for	1
her	1
defence	1
as	1
the	1
trial	1
had	1
proceeded	1
her	1
countenance	1
had	1
altered	1
surprise	1
horror	1
and	1
misery	1
were	1
strongly	1
expressed	1
sometimes	1
she	1
struggled	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
desired	1
to	1
plead	1
she	1
collected	1
her	1
powers	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
an	1
audible	1
although	1
variable	1
voice	1
god	1
knows	1
she	1
said	1
how	1
entirely	1
i	1
am	1
innocent	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
that	1
my	1
protestations	1
should	1
acquit	1
me	1
i	1
rest	1
my	1
innocence	1
on	1
a	1
plain	1
and	1
simple	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
adduced	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
hope	1
the	1
character	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
borne	1
will	1
incline	1
my	1
judges	1
to	1
a	1
favourable	1
interpretation	1
where	1
any	1
circumstance	1
appears	1
doubtful	1
or	1
suspicious	1
she	1
then	1
related	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
committed	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
an	1
aunt	1
at	1
chene	1
a	1
village	1
situated	1
at	1
about	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
geneva	1
on	1
her	1
return	1
at	1
about	1
nine	1
o	1
clock	1
she	1
met	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
lost	1
she	1
was	1
alarmed	1
by	1
this	1
account	1
and	1
passed	1
several	1
hours	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
geneva	1
were	1
shut	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
remain	1
several	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
barn	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
cottage	1
being	1
unwilling	1
to	1
call	1
up	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
spent	1
here	1
watching	1
towards	1
morning	1
she	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
slept	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
some	1
steps	1
disturbed	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
awoke	1
it	1
was	1
dawn	1
and	1
she	1
quitted	1
her	1
asylum	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
again	1
endeavour	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
brother	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
his	1
body	1
lay	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
her	1
knowledge	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
bewildered	1
when	1
questioned	1
by	1
the	1
market	1
woman	1
was	1
not	1
surprising	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
poor	1
william	1
was	1
yet	1
uncertain	1
concerning	1
the	1
picture	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
account	1
i	1
know	1
continued	1
the	1
unhappy	1
victim	1
how	1
heavily	1
and	1
fatally	1
this	1
one	1
circumstance	1
weighs	1
against	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
of	1
explaining	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
expressed	1
my	1
utter	1
ignorance	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
left	1
to	1
conjecture	1
concerning	1
the	1
probabilities	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
but	1
here	1
also	1
i	1
am	1
checked	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
enemy	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
none	1
surely	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
wicked	1
as	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
wantonly	1
did	1
the	1
murderer	1
place	1
it	1
there	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
no	1
opportunity	1
afforded	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
doing	1
or	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
have	1
stolen	1
the	1
jewel	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it	1
again	1
so	1
soon	1
i	1
commit	1
my	1
cause	1
to	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
my	1
judges	1
yet	1
i	1
see	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
hope	1
i	1
beg	1
permission	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
witnesses	1
examined	1
concerning	1
my	1
character	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
testimony	1
shall	1
not	1
overweigh	1
my	1
supposed	1
guilt	1
i	1
must	1
be	1
condemned	1
although	1
i	1
would	1
pledge	1
my	1
salvation	1
on	1
my	1
innocence	1
several	1
witnesses	1
were	1
called	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
her	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
they	1
spoke	1
well	1
of	1
her	1
but	1
fear	1
and	1
hatred	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
supposed	1
her	1
guilty	1
rendered	1
them	1
timorous	1
and	1
unwilling	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
elizabeth	1
saw	1
even	1
this	1
last	1
resource	1
her	1
excellent	1
dispositions	1
and	1
irreproachable	1
conduct	1
about	1
to	1
fail	1
the	1
accused	1
when	1
although	1
violently	1
agitated	1
she	1
desired	1
permission	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
court	1
i	1
am	1
said	1
she	1
the	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
unhappy	1
child	1
who	1
was	1
murdered	1
or	1
rather	1
his	1
sister	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
educated	1
by	1
and	1
have	1
lived	1
with	1
his	1
parents	1
ever	1
since	1
and	1
even	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
birth	1
it	1
may	1
therefore	1
be	1
judged	1
indecent	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
see	1
a	1
fellow	1
creature	1
about	1
to	1
perish	1
through	1
the	1
cowardice	1
of	1
her	1
pretended	1
friends	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
i	1
know	1
of	1
her	1
character	1
i	1
am	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
accused	1
i	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
for	1
five	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
during	1
all	1
that	1
period	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
and	1
benevolent	1
of	1
human	1
creatures	1
she	1
nursed	1
madame	1
frankenstein	1
my	1
aunt	1
in	1
her	1
last	1
illness	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
affection	1
and	1
care	1
and	1
afterwards	1
attended	1
her	1
own	1
mother	1
during	1
a	1
tedious	1
illness	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
excited	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
after	1
which	1
she	1
again	1
lived	1
in	1
my	1
uncle	1
s	1
house	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
beloved	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
she	1
was	1
warmly	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
dead	1
and	1
acted	1
towards	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
most	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
evidence	1
produced	1
against	1
her	1
i	1
believe	1
and	1
rely	1
on	1
her	1
perfect	1
innocence	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
temptation	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
action	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
bauble	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
chief	1
proof	1
rests	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
earnestly	1
desired	1
it	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
willingly	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
do	1
i	1
esteem	1
and	1
value	1
her	1
a	1
murmur	1
of	1
approbation	1
followed	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
simple	1
and	1
powerful	1
appeal	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
excited	1
by	1
her	1
generous	1
interference	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
poor	1
justine	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
public	1
indignation	1
was	1
turned	1
with	1
renewed	1
violence	1
charging	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
blackest	1
ingratitude	1
she	1
herself	1
wept	1
as	1
elizabeth	1
spoke	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
my	1
own	1
agitation	1
and	1
anguish	1
was	1
extreme	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
trial	1
i	1
believed	1
in	1
her	1
innocence	1
i	1
knew	1
it	1
could	1
the	1
demon	1
who	1
had	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
doubt	1
murdered	1
my	1
brother	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
hellish	1
sport	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
innocent	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
ignominy	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sustain	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
popular	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
had	1
already	1
condemned	1
my	1
unhappy	1
victim	1
i	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
agony	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
the	1
accused	1
did	1
not	1
equal	1
mine	1
she	1
was	1
sustained	1
by	1
innocence	1
but	1
the	1
fangs	1
of	1
remorse	1
tore	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
forgo	1
their	1
hold	1
i	1
passed	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
unmingled	1
wretchedness	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
my	1
lips	1
and	1
throat	1
were	1
parched	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
ask	1
the	1
fatal	1
question	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
guessed	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
visit	1
the	1
ballots	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
black	1
and	1
justine	1
was	1
condemned	1
i	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
i	1
then	1
felt	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
experienced	1
sensations	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
them	1
adequate	1
expressions	1
but	1
words	1
cannot	1
convey	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
sickening	1
despair	1
that	1
i	1
then	1
endured	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
addressed	1
myself	1
added	1
that	1
justine	1
had	1
already	1
confessed	1
her	1
guilt	1
that	1
evidence	1
he	1
observed	1
was	1
hardly	1
required	1
in	1
so	1
glaring	1
a	1
case	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
indeed	1
none	1
of	1
our	1
judges	1
like	1
to	1
condemn	1
a	1
criminal	1
upon	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
decisive	1
this	1
was	1
strange	1
and	1
unexpected	1
intelligence	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
mean	1
had	1
my	1
eyes	1
deceived	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
i	1
really	1
as	1
mad	1
as	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
would	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
i	1
disclosed	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
suspicions	1
i	1
hastened	1
to	1
return	1
home	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
eagerly	1
demanded	1
the	1
result	1
my	1
cousin	1
replied	1
i	1
it	1
is	1
decided	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
expected	1
all	1
judges	1
had	1
rather	1
that	1
ten	1
innocent	1
should	1
suffer	1
than	1
that	1
one	1
guilty	1
should	1
escape	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
confessed	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
dire	1
blow	1
to	1
poor	1
elizabeth	1
who	1
had	1
relied	1
with	1
firmness	1
upon	1
justine	1
s	1
innocence	1
alas	1
said	1
she	1
how	1
shall	1
i	1
ever	1
again	1
believe	1
in	1
human	1
goodness	1
justine	1
whom	1
i	1
loved	1
and	1
esteemed	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
how	1
could	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
those	1
smiles	1
of	1
innocence	1
only	1
to	1
betray	1
her	1
mild	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
severity	1
or	1
guile	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
has	1
committed	1
a	1
murder	1
soon	1
after	1
we	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
victim	1
had	1
expressed	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
cousin	1
my	1
father	1
wished	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
but	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
judgment	1
and	1
feelings	1
to	1
decide	1
yes	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
although	1
she	1
is	1
guilty	1
and	1
you	1
victor	1
shall	1
accompany	1
me	1
i	1
cannot	1
go	1
alone	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
visit	1
was	1
torture	1
to	1
me	1
yet	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
we	1
entered	1
the	1
gloomy	1
prison	1
chamber	1
and	1
beheld	1
justine	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
straw	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
manacled	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
rested	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
she	1
rose	1
on	1
seeing	1
us	1
enter	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
she	1
threw	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
weeping	1
bitterly	1
my	1
cousin	1
wept	1
also	1
oh	1
justine	1
said	1
she	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
last	1
consolation	1
i	1
relied	1
on	1
your	1
innocence	1
and	1
although	1
i	1
was	1
then	1
very	1
wretched	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
miserable	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
also	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
so	1
very	1
very	1
wicked	1
do	1
you	1
also	1
join	1
with	1
my	1
enemies	1
to	1
crush	1
me	1
to	1
condemn	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
murderer	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
suffocated	1
with	1
sobs	1
rise	1
my	1
poor	1
girl	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
kneel	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
innocent	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
i	1
believed	1
you	1
guiltless	1
notwithstanding	1
every	1
evidence	1
until	1
i	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
yourself	1
declared	1
your	1
guilt	1
that	1
report	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
false	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
dear	1
justine	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
shake	1
my	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
confession	1
i	1
did	1
confess	1
but	1
i	1
confessed	1
a	1
lie	1
i	1
confessed	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
obtain	1
absolution	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
falsehood	1
lies	1
heavier	1
at	1
my	1
heart	1
than	1
all	1
my	1
other	1
sins	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
heaven	1
forgive	1
me	1
ever	1
since	1
i	1
was	1
condemned	1
my	1
confessor	1
has	1
besieged	1
me	1
he	1
threatened	1
and	1
menaced	1
until	1
i	1
almost	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
monster	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
was	1
he	1
threatened	1
excommunication	1
and	1
hell	1
fire	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
moments	1
if	1
i	1
continued	1
obdurate	1
dear	1
lady	1
i	1
had	1
none	1
to	1
support	1
me	1
all	1
looked	1
on	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
wretch	1
doomed	1
to	1
ignominy	1
and	1
perdition	1
what	1
could	1
i	1
do	1
in	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
i	1
subscribed	1
to	1
a	1
lie	1
and	1
now	1
only	1
am	1
i	1
truly	1
miserable	1
she	1
paused	1
weeping	1
and	1
then	1
continued	1
i	1
thought	1
with	1
horror	1
my	1
sweet	1
lady	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
believe	1
your	1
justine	1
whom	1
your	1
blessed	1
aunt	1
had	1
so	1
highly	1
honoured	1
and	1
whom	1
you	1
loved	1
was	1
a	1
creature	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
crime	1
which	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
could	1
have	1
perpetrated	1
dear	1
william	1
dearest	1
blessed	1
child	1
i	1
soon	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
in	1
heaven	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
happy	1
and	1
that	1
consoles	1
me	1
going	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
suffer	1
ignominy	1
and	1
death	1
oh	1
justine	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
distrusted	1
you	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
confess	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
mourn	1
dear	1
girl	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
i	1
will	1
proclaim	1
i	1
will	1
prove	1
your	1
innocence	1
i	1
will	1
melt	1
the	1
stony	1
hearts	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
by	1
my	1
tears	1
and	1
prayers	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
die	1
you	1
my	1
playfellow	1
my	1
companion	1
my	1
sister	1
perish	1
on	1
the	1
scaffold	1
no	1
no	1
i	1
never	1
could	1
survive	1
so	1
horrible	1
a	1
misfortune	1
justine	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
mournfully	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
to	1
die	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
pang	1
is	1
past	1
god	1
raises	1
my	1
weakness	1
and	1
gives	1
me	1
courage	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
worst	1
i	1
leave	1
a	1
sad	1
and	1
bitter	1
world	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
remember	1
me	1
and	1

of	1

unjustly	1
condemned	1

the	1

from	1
me	1
dear	1
lady	1
to	1
submit	1
in	1
patience	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
heaven	1
during	1
this	1
conversation	1
i	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
room	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
conceal	1
the	1
horrid	1
anguish	1
that	1
possessed	1
me	1
despair	1
who	1
dared	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
victim	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
awful	1
boundary	1
between	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
felt	1
not	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
such	1
deep	1
and	1
bitter	1
agony	1
i	1
gnashed	1
my	1
teeth	1
and	1
ground	1
them	1
together	1
uttering	1
a	1
groan	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
my	1
inmost	1
soul	1
justine	1
started	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
approached	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
dear	1
sir	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
visit	1
me	1
you	1
i	1
hope	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
guilty	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
no	1
justine	1
said	1
elizabeth	1
he	1
is	1
more	1
convinced	1
of	1
your	1
innocence	1
than	1
i	1
was	1
for	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
confessed	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
credit	1
it	1
i	1
truly	1
thank	1
him	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
i	1
feel	1
the	1
sincerest	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
with	1
kindness	1
how	1
sweet	1
is	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
wretch	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
it	1
removes	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
my	1
misfortune	1
and	1
i	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
die	1
in	1
peace	1
now	1
that	1
my	1
innocence	1
is	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
you	1
dear	1
lady	1
and	1
your	1
cousin	1
thus	1
the	1
poor	1
sufferer	1
tried	1
to	1
comfort	1
others	1
and	1
herself	1
she	1
indeed	1
gained	1
the	1
resignation	1
she	1
desired	1
but	1
i	1
the	1
true	1
murderer	1
felt	1
the	1
never	1
dying	1
worm	1
alive	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
which	1
allowed	1
of	1
no	1
hope	1
or	1
consolation	1
elizabeth	1
also	1
wept	1
and	1
was	1
unhappy	1
but	1
hers	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
innocence	1
which	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
passes	1
over	1
the	1
fair	1
moon	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
hides	1
but	1
cannot	1
tarnish	1
its	1
brightness	1
anguish	1
and	1
despair	1
had	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
bore	1
a	1
hell	1
within	1
me	1
which	1
nothing	1
could	1
extinguish	1
we	1
stayed	1
several	1
hours	1
with	1
justine	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
could	1
tear	1
herself	1
away	1
i	1
wish	1
cried	1
she	1
that	1
i	1
were	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
cannot	1
live	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
of	1
misery	1
justine	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
while	1
she	1
with	1
difficulty	1
repressed	1
her	1
bitter	1
tears	1
she	1
embraced	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
half	1
suppressed	1
emotion	1
farewell	1
sweet	1
lady	1
dearest	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
beloved	1
and	1
only	1
friend	1
may	1
heaven	1
in	1
its	1
bounty	1
bless	1
and	1
preserve	1
you	1
may	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
misfortune	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
suffer	1
live	1
and	1
be	1
happy	1

make	1

so	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
justine	1
died	1
elizabeth	1

from	1

in	1
the	1
criminality	1
of	1
the	1
saintly	1
sufferer	1
my	1
passionate	1
and	1
indignant	1
appeals	1
were	1
lost	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
received	1
their	1
cold	1
answers	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
harsh	1
unfeeling	1
reasoning	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
my	1
purposed	1

died	1
away	1
on	1
my	1

thus	1
i	1
might	1
proclaim	1
myself	1
a	1
madman	1

not	1
revoke	1
the	1
sentence	1
passed	1
upon	1
my	1
wretched	1
victim	1
she	1
perished	1
on	1
the	1
scaffold	1
as	1
a	1
murderess	1
from	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
my	1
own	1

i	1
turned	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
deep	1

voiceless	1
grief	1
of	1
my	1

this	1

make	1
myself	1

beings	1
now	1
all	1
was	1
blasted	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
serenity	1
of	1

which	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1

self	1
satisfaction	1

from	1
thence	1
to	1

i	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
remorse	1

the	1
sense	1
of	1
guilt	1
which	1
hurried	1
me	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
hell	1
of	1
intense	1
tortures	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
language	1
can	1
describe	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
preyed	1
upon	1
my	1
health	1
which	1
had	1
perhaps	1
never	1
entirely	1
recovered	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
shock	1
it	1
had	1
sustained	1
i	1
shunned	1
the	1

of	1

my	1
only	1
consolation	1
deep	1
dark	1
deathlike	1
solitude	1
my	1
father	1
observed	1
with	1
pain	1
the	1
alteration	1
perceptible	1
in	1
my	1
disposition	1
and	1
habits	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
arguments	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
his	1
serene	1
conscience	1
and	1
guiltless	1
life	1
to	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
fortitude	1
and	1
awaken	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
dispel	1
the	1
dark	1
cloud	1

brooded	1
over	1

you	1
think	1
victor	1
said	1
he	1
that	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
also	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
love	1
a	1
child	1
more	1
than	1
i	1
loved	1
your	1
brother	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
but	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
the	1
survivors	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
refrain	1
from	1
augmenting	1
their	1
unhappiness	1
by	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
immoderate	1
grief	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
duty	1
owed	1
to	1
yourself	1
for	1
excessive	1
sorrow	1
prevents	1
improvement	1
or	1
enjoyment	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
daily	1
usefulness	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
society	1
this	1
advice	1
although	1
good	1
was	1
totally	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
my	1
case	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
hide	1
my	1
grief	1
and	1
console	1
my	1
friends	1
if	1
remorse	1
had	1
not	1
mingled	1
its	1
bitterness	1
and	1
terror	1
its	1
alarm	1
with	1
my	1
other	1
sensations	1
now	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
answer	1
my	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
despair	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
hide	1
myself	1
from	1
his	1
view	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
we	1
retired	1
to	1
our	1
house	1
at	1
belrive	1
this	1
change	1
was	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
shutting	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
regularly	1
at	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
and	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
remaining	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
after	1
that	1
hour	1
had	1
rendered	1
our	1
residence	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
geneva	1
very	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
free	1
often	1
after	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
retired	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
passed	1
many	1
hours	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
sometimes	1
with	1
my	1
sails	1
set	1
i	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
sometimes	1
after	1
rowing	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
pursue	1
its	1
own	1
course	1
and	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
miserable	1
reflections	1
i	1
was	1
often	1
tempted	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
the	1
only	1
unquiet	1
thing	1
that	1
wandered	1
restless	1
in	1
a	1
scene	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
heavenly	1
if	1
i	1
except	1
some	1
bat	1
or	1
the	1
frogs	1
whose	1
harsh	1
and	1
interrupted	1
croaking	1
was	1
heard	1
only	1
when	1
i	1
approached	1
the	1
shore	1
often	1
i	1
say	1
i	1
was	1
tempted	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
silent	1
lake	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
might	1
close	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
calamities	1
forever	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
restrained	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
heroic	1
and	1
suffering	1
elizabeth	1
whom	1
i	1
tenderly	1
loved	1
and	1
whose	1
existence	1
was	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
mine	1
i	1
thought	1
also	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
surviving	1
brother	1
should	1
i	1
by	1
my	1
base	1
desertion	1
leave	1
them	1
exposed	1
and	1
unprotected	1
to	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
these	1
moments	1
i	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
and	1
wished	1
that	1
peace	1
would	1
revisit	1
my	1
mind	1
only	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
afford	1
them	1
consolation	1
and	1
happiness	1
but	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
remorse	1
extinguished	1
every	1
hope	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
unalterable	1
evils	1
and	1
i	1
lived	1
in	1
daily	1
fear	1
lest	1
the	1
monster	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
should	1
perpetrate	1
some	1
new	1
wickedness	1
i	1
had	1
an	1
obscure	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
commit	1
some	1
signal	1
crime	1
which	1
by	1
its	1
enormity	1
should	1
almost	1
efface	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
scope	1
for	1
fear	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
anything	1
i	1
loved	1
remained	1
behind	1
my	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
this	1
fiend	1
cannot	1
be	1
conceived	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
gnashed	1
my	1
teeth	1
my	1
eyes	1
became	1
inflamed	1
and	1
i	1
ardently	1
wished	1
to	1
extinguish	1
that	1
life	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
thoughtlessly	1
bestowed	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
on	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
malice	1
my	1
hatred	1
and	1
revenge	1
burst	1
all	1
bounds	1
of	1
moderation	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
pilgrimage	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
peak	1
of	1
the	1
andes	1
could	1
i	1
when	1
there	1
have	1
precipitated	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
base	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
again	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
wreak	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
abhorrence	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
avenge	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
william	1
and	1
justine	1
our	1
house	1
was	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning	1
my	1

health	1
was	1
deeply	1
shaken	1
by	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1

i	1

if	1

assuredly	1
she	1

the	1

despair	1
that	1
overwhelmed	1
me	1

sometimes	1
the	1
whirlwind	1

me	1
to	1
seek	1
by	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
and	1
by	1
change	1
of	1
place	1
some	1
relief	1
from	1
my	1
intolerable	1

it	1
was	1
during	1
an	1
access	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
that	1
i	1
suddenly	1
left	1
my	1
home	1
and	1
bending	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
near	1
alpine	1
valleys	1
sought	1
in	1
the	1
magnificence	1
the	1
eternity	1
of	1
such	1
scenes	1
to	1
forget	1
myself	1
and	1
my	1
ephemeral	1
because	1
human	1
sorrows	1
my	1
wanderings	1
were	1
directed	1
towards	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
chamounix	1
i	1

visited	1
it	1
frequently	1
during	1
my	1
boyhood	1
six	1
years	1

passed	1
since	1
then	1
_i_	1
was	1
a	1

nought	1

in	1
those	1
savage	1

enduring	1
scenes	1
i	1
performed	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
on	1
horseback	1
i	1
afterwards	1
hired	1
a	1
mule	1

the	1
more	1
sure	1

liable	1
to	1
receive	1
injury	1

about	1

of	1
the	1
month	1

nearly	1
two	1
months	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1

that	1
miserable	1
epoch	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
dated	1
all	1
my	1
woe	1
the	1
weight	1
upon	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
sensibly	1
lightened	1
as	1
i	1
plunged	1
yet	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
ravine	1
of	1
arve	1
the	1
immense	1
mountains	1
and	1
precipices	1
that	1
overhung	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
raging	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
waterfalls	1
around	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
mighty	1
as	1
omnipotence	1
and	1
i	1
ceased	1
to	1
fear	1
or	1
to	1
bend	1
before	1
any	1
being	1
less	1
almighty	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
created	1
and	1
ruled	1
the	1
elements	1
here	1
displayed	1
in	1
their	1
most	1
terrific	1
guise	1
still	1
as	1
i	1
ascended	1
higher	1

magnificent	1

astonishing	1

every	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
peeping	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
formed	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
singular	1
beauty	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
augmented	1
and	1
rendered	1
sublime	1
by	1
the	1
mighty	1
alps	1
whose	1
white	1
and	1
shining	1
pyramids	1
and	1
domes	1
towered	1
above	1

as	1
belonging	1
to	1
another	1

i	1
passed	1
the	1

of	1

where	1
the	1
ravine	1
which	1
the	1
river	1
forms	1
opened	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
ascend	1
the	1
mountain	1
that	1
overhangs	1
it	1
soon	1
after	1
i	1
entered	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
chamounix	1
this	1
valley	1
is	1
more	1
wonderful	1
and	1
sublime	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
picturesque	1
as	1
that	1

passed	1

fertile	1
fields	1

approached	1
the	1

i	1
heard	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

the	1

a	1
tingling	1
long	1
lost	1
sense	1

came	1
across	1
me	1
during	1
this	1

some	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
some	1
new	1
object	1
suddenly	1
perceived	1
and	1
recognized	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
days	1
gone	1
by	1
and	1
were	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
lighthearted	1
gaiety	1
of	1
boyhood	1
the	1
very	1
winds	1
whispered	1
in	1
soothing	1
accents	1
and	1
maternal	1
nature	1
bade	1
me	1
weep	1
no	1
more	1
then	1
again	1
the	1
kindly	1
influence	1
ceased	1
to	1

i	1
found	1
myself	1
fettered	1
again	1
to	1
grief	1

indulging	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1

i	1
spurred	1
on	1
my	1

fears	1

more	1
than	1
all	1
myself	1

in	1
a	1
more	1
desperate	1
fashion	1
i	1
alighted	1

myself	1
on	1
the	1

down	1
by	1
horror	1

my	1

they	1
subdued	1

it	1

their	1
misty	1
veil	1
and	1
seek	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
cloudy	1
retreats	1
what	1
were	1
rain	1
and	1
storm	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
mule	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
ascend	1
to	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
montanvert	1
i	1
remembered	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
and	1
ever	1
moving	1
glacier	1
had	1
produced	1
upon	1
my	1
mind	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
it	1
it	1
had	1
then	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sublime	1
ecstasy	1
that	1
gave	1
wings	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
and	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
soar	1
from	1
the	1
obscure	1
world	1
to	1
light	1
and	1
joy	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
awful	1
and	1
majestic	1
in	1
nature	1
had	1
indeed	1
always	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
solemnizing	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
causing	1
me	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
passing	1
cares	1
of	1
life	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
a	1
guide	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
another	1
would	1
destroy	1
the	1
solitary	1
grandeur	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
the	1
ascent	1
is	1
precipitous	1
but	1
the	1
path	1
is	1
cut	1
into	1
continual	1
and	1
short	1
windings	1
which	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
surmount	1
the	1
perpendicularity	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
scene	1
terrifically	1
desolate	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
spots	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
avalanche	1
may	1
be	1
perceived	1
where	1
trees	1
lie	1
broken	1
and	1
strewed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
some	1
entirely	1
destroyed	1
others	1
bent	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
jutting	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
or	1
transversely	1
upon	1
other	1
trees	1
the	1
path	1
as	1
you	1
ascend	1
higher	1
is	1
intersected	1
by	1
ravines	1
of	1
snow	1
down	1
which	1
stones	1
continually	1
roll	1
from	1
above	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
particularly	1
dangerous	1
as	1
the	1
slightest	1
sound	1
such	1
as	1
even	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
produces	1
a	1
concussion	1
of	1
air	1
sufficient	1
to	1
draw	1
destruction	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
speaker	1
the	1
pines	1
are	1
not	1
tall	1
or	1
luxuriant	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
sombre	1
and	1
add	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
severity	1
to	1
the	1
scene	1
i	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
valley	1
beneath	1
vast	1
mists	1
were	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
rivers	1
which	1
ran	1
through	1
it	1
and	1
curling	1
in	1
thick	1
wreaths	1
around	1
the	1
opposite	1
mountains	1
whose	1
summits	1
were	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
clouds	1
while	1
rain	1
poured	1
from	1
the	1
dark	1
sky	1
and	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
melancholy	1
impression	1
i	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
objects	1
around	1
me	1
alas	1
why	1
does	1
man	1
boast	1
of	1
sensibilities	1
superior	1
to	1
those	1
apparent	1
in	1
the	1
brute	1
it	1
only	1
renders	1
them	1
more	1
necessary	1
beings	1
if	1
our	1
impulses	1
were	1
confined	1
to	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
desire	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
nearly	1
free	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
moved	1
by	1
every	1
wind	1
that	1
blows	1
and	1
a	1
chance	1
word	1
or	1
scene	1
that	1
that	1
word	1
may	1
convey	1
to	1
us	1
we	1
rest	1
a	1
dream	1
has	1
power	1
to	1
poison	1
sleep	1
we	1
rise	1
one	1
wand	1
ring	1

pollutes	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
feel	1

or	1
reason	1
laugh	1
or	1

fond	1
woe	1

nought	1
may	1

but	1
mutability	1
it	1
was	1
nearly	1
noon	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
ascent	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
i	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
that	1
overlooks	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
a	1
mist	1
covered	1
both	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
surrounding	1
mountains	1
presently	1
a	1
breeze	1
dissipated	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
i	1
descended	1
upon	1
the	1
glacier	1
the	1
surface	1
is	1
very	1
uneven	1
rising	1
like	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
a	1
troubled	1
sea	1
descending	1
low	1
and	1
interspersed	1
by	1
rifts	1
that	1
sink	1
deep	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
ice	1
is	1
almost	1
a	1
league	1
in	1
width	1
but	1
i	1
spent	1
nearly	1
two	1
hours	1
in	1
crossing	1
it	1
the	1
opposite	1
mountain	1
is	1
a	1
bare	1
perpendicular	1
rock	1
from	1
the	1
side	1
where	1
i	1
now	1
stood	1
montanvert	1
was	1
exactly	1
opposite	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
and	1
above	1
it	1
rose	1
mont	1
blanc	1
in	1
awful	1
majesty	1
i	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
gazing	1
on	1
this	1
wonderful	1
and	1
stupendous	1
scene	1
the	1
sea	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
vast	1
river	1
of	1
ice	1
wound	1
among	1
its	1
dependent	1
mountains	1
whose	1
aerial	1
summits	1
hung	1
over	1
its	1
recesses	1
their	1
icy	1
and	1
glittering	1
peaks	1
shone	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight	1
over	1
the	1
clouds	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
sorrowful	1
now	1
swelled	1
with	1
something	1
like	1
joy	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
wandering	1
spirits	1
if	1
indeed	1
ye	1
wander	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
rest	1
in	1
your	1
narrow	1
beds	1
allow	1
me	1
this	1
faint	1
happiness	1
or	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
your	1
companion	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
this	1
i	1
suddenly	1
beheld	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
advancing	1
towards	1
me	1
with	1
superhuman	1
speed	1
he	1
bounded	1
over	1
the	1
crevices	1
in	1
the	1
ice	1
among	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
walked	1
with	1
caution	1
his	1
stature	1
also	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
seemed	1
to	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
man	1
i	1
was	1
troubled	1
a	1
mist	1
came	1
over	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
faintness	1
seize	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
quickly	1
restored	1
by	1
the	1
cold	1
gale	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
i	1
perceived	1
as	1
the	1
shape	1
came	1
nearer	1
sight	1
tremendous	1
and	1
abhorred	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
i	1
trembled	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
horror	1
resolving	1
to	1
wait	1
his	1
approach	1
and	1
then	1
close	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mortal	1
combat	1
he	1
approached	1
his	1
countenance	1
bespoke	1
bitter	1
anguish	1
combined	1
with	1
disdain	1
and	1
malignity	1
while	1
its	1
unearthly	1
ugliness	1
rendered	1
it	1
almost	1
too	1
horrible	1
for	1
human	1
eyes	1
but	1
i	1
scarcely	1
observed	1
this	1
rage	1
and	1
hatred	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
utterance	1
and	1
i	1
recovered	1
only	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
him	1
with	1
words	1
expressive	1
of	1
furious	1
detestation	1
and	1
contempt	1
devil	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
approach	1
me	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
fear	1
the	1
fierce	1
vengeance	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
wreaked	1
on	1
your	1
miserable	1
head	1
begone	1
vile	1
insect	1
or	1
rather	1
stay	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
trample	1
you	1
to	1
dust	1
and	1
oh	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
with	1
the	1
extinction	1
of	1
your	1
miserable	1
existence	1
restore	1
those	1
victims	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
diabolically	1
murdered	1
i	1
expected	1
this	1
reception	1
said	1
the	1
daemon	1
all	1
men	1
hate	1
the	1
wretched	1
how	1
then	1
must	1
i	1
be	1
hated	1
who	1
am	1
miserable	1
beyond	1
all	1
living	1
things	1
yet	1
you	1
my	1
creator	1
detest	1
and	1
spurn	1
me	1
thy	1
creature	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
bound	1
by	1
ties	1
only	1
dissoluble	1
by	1
the	1
annihilation	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
you	1
purpose	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
how	1
dare	1
you	1
sport	1
thus	1
with	1
life	1
do	1
your	1
duty	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
do	1
mine	1
towards	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mankind	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
comply	1
with	1
my	1
conditions	1
i	1
will	1
leave	1
them	1
and	1
you	1
at	1
peace	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
refuse	1
i	1
will	1
glut	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
death	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
satiated	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
remaining	1
friends	1
abhorred	1
monster	1
fiend	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
hell	1
are	1
too	1
mild	1
a	1
vengeance	1
for	1
thy	1
crimes	1

devil	1
you	1
reproach	1
me	1
with	1
your	1

on	1
then	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
extinguish	1
the	1
spark	1
which	1
i	1
so	1
negligently	1
bestowed	1
my	1
rage	1
was	1
without	1
bounds	1
i	1
sprang	1
on	1
him	1
impelled	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
can	1
arm	1
one	1
being	1
against	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
another	1
he	1
easily	1
eluded	1
me	1
and	1
said	1

calm	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
your	1
hatred	1
on	1
my	1
devoted	1
head	1

i	1
not	1
suffered	1
enough	1
that	1
you	1
seek	1
to	1
increase	1
my	1
misery	1
life	1
although	1
it	1
may	1
only	1
be	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
anguish	1
is	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
defend	1
it	1
remember	1
thou	1

made	1
me	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
thyself	1
my	1
height	1

superior	1
to	1
thine	1
my	1

the	1

me	1

to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
your	1
hands	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
to	1
my	1
remembrance	1
i	1
rejoined	1
circumstances	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
shudder	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
miserable	1
origin	1
and	1
author	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
abhorred	1
devil	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
first	1
saw	1
light	1
cursed	1
although	1
i	1
curse	1
myself	1
be	1
the	1
hands	1
that	1
formed	1
you	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
wretched	1
beyond	1
expression	1
you	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
consider	1
whether	1
i	1
am	1
just	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
not	1
begone	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
detested	1
form	1
thus	1
i	1
relieve	1
thee	1
my	1
creator	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
hated	1
hands	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
i	1
flung	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
violence	1
thus	1
i	1
take	1
from	1
thee	1
a	1
sight	1
which	1
you	1
abhor	1
still	1
thou	1
canst	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
grant	1
me	1
thy	1
compassion	1
by	1
the	1
virtues	1
that	1
i	1
once	1
possessed	1
i	1
demand	1
this	1
from	1
you	1
hear	1
my	1
tale	1
it	1
is	1
long	1
and	1
strange	1
and	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
fitting	1
to	1
your	1
fine	1
sensations	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
upon	1
the	1
mountain	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
yet	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
before	1
it	1
descends	1
to	1
hide	1
itself	1
behind	1
your	1
snowy	1
precipices	1
and	1
illuminate	1
another	1
world	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
story	1
and	1
can	1
decide	1
on	1
you	1
it	1
rests	1
whether	1
i	1
quit	1
forever	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
lead	1
a	1
harmless	1
life	1
or	1
become	1
the	1
scourge	1
of	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
and	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
speedy	1
ruin	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
ice	1
i	1
followed	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
full	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
proceeded	1
i	1
weighed	1
the	1
various	1
arguments	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
and	1
determined	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
tale	1
i	1
was	1
partly	1
urged	1
by	1
curiosity	1
and	1
compassion	1
confirmed	1
my	1
resolution	1
i	1
had	1
hitherto	1
supposed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
i	1
eagerly	1
sought	1
a	1
confirmation	1
or	1
denial	1
of	1
this	1
opinion	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
also	1
i	1
felt	1
what	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
creator	1
towards	1
his	1
creature	1
were	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
render	1
him	1
happy	1
before	1
i	1
complained	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness	1
these	1
motives	1
urged	1
me	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
demand	1
we	1
crossed	1
the	1
ice	1
therefore	1
and	1
ascended	1
the	1
opposite	1
rock	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
descend	1
we	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
the	1
fiend	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
exultation	1
i	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
heart	1
and	1
depressed	1
spirits	1
but	1
i	1
consented	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
seating	1
myself	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
my	1
odious	1
companion	1
had	1
lighted	1
he	1
thus	1
began	1
his	1
tale	1
chapter	1
11	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
that	1
i	1
remember	1
the	1
original	1
era	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
all	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
that	1
period	1
appear	1
confused	1
and	1
indistinct	1
a	1
strange	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
sensations	1
seized	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
felt	1
heard	1
and	1
smelt	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
i	1
learned	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
my	1
various	1
senses	1
by	1
degrees	1
i	1
remember	1
a	1
stronger	1
light	1
pressed	1
upon	1
my	1
nerves	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
darkness	1
then	1
came	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
troubled	1
me	1
but	1
hardly	1
had	1
i	1
felt	1
this	1
when	1
by	1
opening	1
my	1
eyes	1
as	1
i	1
now	1
suppose	1
the	1
light	1
poured	1
in	1
upon	1
me	1
again	1
i	1
walked	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
descended	1
but	1
i	1
presently	1
found	1
a	1
great	1
alteration	1
in	1
my	1
sensations	1
before	1
dark	1
and	1
opaque	1
bodies	1
had	1
surrounded	1
me	1
impervious	1
to	1
my	1
touch	1
or	1
sight	1
but	1
i	1
now	1
found	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
wander	1
on	1
at	1
liberty	1
with	1
no	1
obstacles	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
either	1
surmount	1
or	1
avoid	1
the	1
light	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
oppressive	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
wearying	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
walked	1
i	1
sought	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
receive	1
shade	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
forest	1
near	1
ingolstadt	1
and	1
here	1
i	1
lay	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
brook	1
resting	1
from	1
my	1
fatigue	1
until	1
i	1
felt	1
tormented	1
by	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
this	1
roused	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
nearly	1
dormant	1
state	1
and	1
i	1
ate	1
some	1
berries	1
which	1
i	1
found	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
or	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
i	1
slaked	1
my	1
thirst	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
and	1
then	1
lying	1
down	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
sleep	1
it	1
was	1
dark	1
when	1
i	1
awoke	1
i	1
felt	1
cold	1
also	1
and	1
half	1
frightened	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
instinctively	1
finding	1
myself	1
so	1
desolate	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
quitted	1
your	1
apartment	1
on	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
cold	1
i	1
had	1
covered	1
myself	1
with	1
some	1
clothes	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
insufficient	1
to	1
secure	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
dews	1
of	1
night	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
helpless	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
i	1
knew	1
and	1
could	1
distinguish	1
nothing	1
but	1
feeling	1
pain	1
invade	1
me	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wept	1
soon	1
a	1
gentle	1
light	1
stole	1
over	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
pleasure	1
i	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
beheld	1
a	1
radiant	1
form	1
rise	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
the	1
moon	1
i	1
gazed	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
wonder	1
it	1
moved	1
slowly	1
but	1
it	1
enlightened	1
my	1
path	1
and	1
i	1
again	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
berries	1
i	1
was	1
still	1
cold	1
when	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
huge	1
cloak	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
covered	1
myself	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
no	1
distinct	1
ideas	1
occupied	1
my	1
mind	1
all	1
was	1
confused	1
i	1
felt	1
light	1
and	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
and	1
darkness	1
innumerable	1
sounds	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
various	1
scents	1
saluted	1
me	1
the	1
only	1
object	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
distinguish	1
was	1
the	1
bright	1
moon	1
and	1
i	1
fixed	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
that	1
with	1
pleasure	1
several	1
changes	1
of	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
orb	1
of	1
night	1
had	1
greatly	1
lessened	1
when	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
distinguish	1
my	1
sensations	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
i	1
gradually	1
saw	1
plainly	1
the	1
clear	1
stream	1
that	1
supplied	1
me	1
with	1
drink	1
and	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
shaded	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
foliage	1
i	1
was	1
delighted	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
discovered	1
that	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sound	1
which	1
often	1
saluted	1
my	1
ears	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
throats	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
winged	1
animals	1
who	1
had	1
often	1
intercepted	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
i	1
began	1
also	1
to	1
observe	1
with	1
greater	1
accuracy	1
the	1
forms	1
that	1
surrounded	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
perceive	1
the	1
boundaries	1
of	1
the	1
radiant	1
roof	1
of	1
light	1
which	1
canopied	1
me	1
sometimes	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
pleasant	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
sometimes	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
sensations	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mode	1
but	1
the	1
uncouth	1
and	1
inarticulate	1
sounds	1
which	1
broke	1
from	1
me	1
frightened	1
me	1
into	1
silence	1
again	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
lessened	1
form	1
showed	1
itself	1
while	1
i	1
still	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
my	1
sensations	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
become	1
distinct	1
and	1
my	1
mind	1
received	1
every	1
day	1
additional	1
ideas	1
my	1
eyes	1
became	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
to	1
perceive	1
objects	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
forms	1
i	1
distinguished	1
the	1
insect	1
from	1
the	1
herb	1
and	1
by	1
degrees	1
one	1
herb	1
from	1
another	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
sparrow	1
uttered	1
none	1
but	1
harsh	1
notes	1
whilst	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
blackbird	1
and	1
thrush	1
were	1
sweet	1
and	1
enticing	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
cold	1
i	1
found	1
a	1
fire	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
by	1
some	1
wandering	1
beggars	1
and	1
was	1
overcome	1
with	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
warmth	1
i	1
experienced	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
joy	1
i	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
live	1
embers	1
but	1
quickly	1
drew	1
it	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
pain	1
how	1
strange	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
should	1
produce	1
such	1
opposite	1
effects	1
i	1
examined	1
the	1
materials	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
joy	1
found	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
wood	1
i	1
quickly	1
collected	1
some	1
branches	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
wet	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
burn	1
i	1
was	1
pained	1
at	1
this	1
and	1
sat	1
still	1
watching	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
the	1
wet	1
wood	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
placed	1
near	1
the	1
heat	1
dried	1
and	1
itself	1
became	1
inflamed	1
i	1
reflected	1
on	1
this	1
and	1
by	1
touching	1
the	1
various	1
branches	1
i	1
discovered	1
the	1
cause	1
and	1
busied	1
myself	1
in	1
collecting	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
wood	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
dry	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
plentiful	1
supply	1
of	1
fire	1
when	1
night	1
came	1
on	1
and	1
brought	1
sleep	1
with	1
it	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
fear	1
lest	1
my	1
fire	1
should	1
be	1
extinguished	1
i	1
covered	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
dry	1
wood	1
and	1
leaves	1
and	1
placed	1
wet	1
branches	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
spreading	1
my	1
cloak	1
i	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
sank	1
into	1
sleep	1
it	1
was	1
morning	1
when	1
i	1
awoke	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
care	1
was	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
fire	1
i	1
uncovered	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
quickly	1
fanned	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
flame	1
i	1
observed	1
this	1
also	1
and	1
contrived	1
a	1
fan	1
of	1
branches	1
which	1
roused	1
the	1
embers	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
nearly	1
extinguished	1
when	1
night	1
came	1
again	1
i	1
found	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
gave	1
light	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
heat	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
this	1
element	1
was	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
food	1
for	1
i	1
found	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
offals	1
that	1
the	1
travellers	1
had	1
left	1
had	1
been	1
roasted	1
and	1
tasted	1
much	1
more	1
savoury	1
than	1
the	1
berries	1
i	1
gathered	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
i	1
tried	1
therefore	1
to	1
dress	1
my	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
placing	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
live	1
embers	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
berries	1
were	1
spoiled	1
by	1
this	1
operation	1
and	1
the	1
nuts	1
and	1
roots	1
much	1
improved	1
food	1
however	1
became	1
scarce	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
searching	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
acorns	1
to	1
assuage	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
hunger	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
this	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
hitherto	1
inhabited	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
one	1
where	1
the	1
few	1
wants	1
i	1
experienced	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
easily	1
satisfied	1
in	1
this	1
emigration	1
i	1
exceedingly	1
lamented	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
obtained	1
through	1
accident	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
reproduce	1
it	1
i	1
gave	1
several	1
hours	1
to	1
the	1
serious	1
consideration	1
of	1
this	1
difficulty	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
relinquish	1
all	1
attempt	1
to	1
supply	1
it	1
and	1
wrapping	1
myself	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
cloak	1
i	1
struck	1
across	1
the	1
wood	1
towards	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
i	1
passed	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
these	1
rambles	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
discovered	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
a	1
great	1
fall	1
of	1
snow	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
uniform	1
white	1
the	1
appearance	1
was	1
disconsolate	1
and	1
i	1
found	1
my	1
feet	1
chilled	1
by	1
the	1
cold	1
damp	1
substance	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
obtain	1
food	1
and	1
shelter	1
at	1
length	1
i	1
perceived	1
a	1
small	1
hut	1
on	1
a	1
rising	1
ground	1
which	1
had	1
doubtless	1
been	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
some	1
shepherd	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
sight	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
examined	1
the	1
structure	1
with	1
great	1
curiosity	1
finding	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
i	1
entered	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
sat	1
in	1
it	1
near	1
a	1
fire	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
his	1
breakfast	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
hearing	1
a	1
noise	1
and	1
perceiving	1
me	1
shrieked	1
loudly	1
and	1
quitting	1
the	1
hut	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
with	1
a	1
speed	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
debilitated	1
form	1
hardly	1
appeared	1
capable	1
his	1
appearance	1
different	1
from	1
any	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
seen	1
and	1
his	1
flight	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
here	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
rain	1
could	1
not	1
penetrate	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
it	1
presented	1
to	1
me	1
then	1
as	1
exquisite	1
and	1
divine	1
a	1
retreat	1
as	1
pandemonium	1
appeared	1
to	1
the	1
demons	1
of	1
hell	1
after	1
their	1
sufferings	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
i	1
greedily	1
devoured	1
the	1
remnants	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
s	1
breakfast	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
bread	1
cheese	1
milk	1
and	1
wine	1
the	1
latter	1
however	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
then	1
overcome	1
by	1
fatigue	1
i	1
lay	1
down	1
among	1
some	1
straw	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
it	1
was	1
noon	1
when	1
i	1
awoke	1
and	1
allured	1
by	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
which	1
shone	1
brightly	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
ground	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
recommence	1
my	1
travels	1
and	1
depositing	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
peasant	1
s	1
breakfast	1
in	1
a	1
wallet	1
i	1
found	1
i	1
proceeded	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
until	1
at	1
sunset	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
village	1
how	1
miraculous	1
did	1
this	1
appear	1
the	1
huts	1
the	1
neater	1
cottages	1
and	1
stately	1
houses	1
engaged	1
my	1
admiration	1
by	1
turns	1
the	1
vegetables	1
in	1
the	1
gardens	1
the	1
milk	1
and	1
cheese	1
that	1
i	1
saw	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
cottages	1
allured	1
my	1
appetite	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
these	1
i	1
entered	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
hardly	1
placed	1
my	1
foot	1
within	1
the	1
door	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
shrieked	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
fainted	1
the	1
whole	1
village	1
was	1
roused	1
some	1
fled	1
some	1
attacked	1
me	1
until	1
grievously	1
bruised	1
by	1
stones	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1
missile	1
weapons	1
i	1
escaped	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
country	1
and	1
fearfully	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
hovel	1
quite	1
bare	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
wretched	1
appearance	1
after	1
the	1
palaces	1
i	1
had	1
beheld	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
this	1
hovel	1
however	1
joined	1
a	1
cottage	1
of	1
a	1
neat	1
and	1
pleasant	1
appearance	1
but	1
after	1
my	1
late	1
dearly	1
bought	1
experience	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
enter	1
it	1
my	1
place	1
of	1
refuge	1
was	1
constructed	1
of	1
wood	1
but	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
with	1
difficulty	1
sit	1
upright	1
in	1
it	1
no	1
wood	1
however	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
floor	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
wind	1
entered	1
it	1
by	1
innumerable	1
chinks	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
an	1
agreeable	1
asylum	1
from	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
rain	1
here	1
then	1
i	1
retreated	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
happy	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
shelter	1
however	1
miserable	1
from	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
season	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
barbarity	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
morning	1
dawned	1
i	1
crept	1
from	1
my	1
kennel	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
view	1
the	1
adjacent	1
cottage	1
and	1
discover	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
habitation	1
i	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
situated	1
against	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
surrounded	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
which	1
were	1
exposed	1
by	1
a	1
pig	1
sty	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
pool	1
of	1
water	1
one	1
part	1
was	1
open	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
crept	1
in	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
covered	1
every	1
crevice	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
perceived	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
wood	1
yet	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
move	1
them	1
on	1
occasion	1
to	1
pass	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
light	1
i	1
enjoyed	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
sty	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
sufficient	1
for	1
me	1
having	1
thus	1
arranged	1
my	1
dwelling	1
and	1
carpeted	1
it	1
with	1
clean	1
straw	1
i	1
retired	1
for	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
i	1
remembered	1
too	1
well	1
my	1
treatment	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
to	1
trust	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
i	1
had	1
first	1
however	1
provided	1
for	1
my	1
sustenance	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
by	1
a	1
loaf	1
of	1
coarse	1
bread	1
which	1
i	1
purloined	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
drink	1
more	1
conveniently	1
than	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
pure	1
water	1
which	1
flowed	1
by	1
my	1
retreat	1
the	1
floor	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
raised	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
kept	1
perfectly	1
dry	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
vicinity	1
to	1
the	1
chimney	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
it	1
was	1
tolerably	1
warm	1
being	1
thus	1
provided	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
reside	1
in	1
this	1
hovel	1
until	1
something	1
should	1
occur	1
which	1
might	1
alter	1
my	1
determination	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
paradise	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
bleak	1
forest	1
my	1
former	1
residence	1
the	1
rain	1
dropping	1
branches	1
and	1
dank	1
earth	1
i	1
ate	1
my	1
breakfast	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
remove	1
a	1
plank	1
to	1
procure	1
myself	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
step	1
and	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
small	1
chink	1
i	1
beheld	1
a	1
young	1
creature	1
with	1
a	1
pail	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
passing	1
before	1
my	1
hovel	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
of	1
gentle	1
demeanour	1
unlike	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
since	1
found	1
cottagers	1
and	1
farmhouse	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
yet	1
she	1
was	1
meanly	1
dressed	1
a	1
coarse	1
blue	1
petticoat	1
and	1
a	1
linen	1
jacket	1
being	1
her	1
only	1
garb	1
her	1
fair	1
hair	1
was	1
plaited	1
but	1
not	1
adorned	1
she	1
looked	1
patient	1
yet	1
sad	1
i	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
she	1
returned	1
bearing	1
the	1
pail	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
partly	1
filled	1
with	1
milk	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
along	1
seemingly	1
incommoded	1
by	1
the	1
burden	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
met	1
her	1
whose	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
a	1
deeper	1
despondence	1
uttering	1
a	1
few	1
sounds	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
melancholy	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pail	1
from	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
bore	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
himself	1
she	1
followed	1
and	1
they	1
disappeared	1
presently	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
again	1
with	1
some	1
tools	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
cross	1
the	1
field	1
behind	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
also	1
busied	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
on	1
examining	1
my	1
dwelling	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
had	1
formerly	1
occupied	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
panes	1
had	1
been	1
filled	1
up	1
with	1
wood	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
and	1
almost	1
imperceptible	1
chink	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
eye	1
could	1
just	1
penetrate	1
through	1
this	1
crevice	1
a	1
small	1
room	1
was	1
visible	1
whitewashed	1
and	1
clean	1
but	1
very	1
bare	1
of	1
furniture	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
near	1
a	1
small	1
fire	1
sat	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
leaning	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
a	1
disconsolate	1
attitude	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
arranging	1
the	1
cottage	1
but	1
presently	1
she	1
took	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
drawer	1
which	1
employed	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
taking	1
up	1
an	1
instrument	1
began	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
to	1
produce	1
sounds	1
sweeter	1
than	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
thrush	1
or	1
the	1
nightingale	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
sight	1
even	1
to	1
me	1
poor	1
wretch	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
beheld	1
aught	1
beautiful	1
before	1
the	1
silver	1
hair	1
and	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
aged	1
cottager	1
won	1
my	1
reverence	1
while	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
enticed	1
my	1
love	1
he	1
played	1
a	1
sweet	1
mournful	1
air	1
which	1
i	1
perceived	1
drew	1
tears	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
amiable	1
companion	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
until	1
she	1
sobbed	1
audibly	1
he	1
then	1
pronounced	1
a	1
few	1
sounds	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
creature	1
leaving	1
her	1
work	1
knelt	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
raised	1
her	1
and	1
smiled	1
with	1
such	1
kindness	1
and	1
affection	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
sensations	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
overpowering	1
nature	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
pleasure	1
such	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
experienced	1
either	1
from	1
hunger	1
or	1
cold	1
warmth	1
or	1
food	1
and	1
i	1
withdrew	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
these	1
emotions	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
returned	1
bearing	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wood	1
the	1
girl	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
helped	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
burden	1
and	1
taking	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
fuel	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
then	1
she	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
went	1
apart	1
into	1
a	1
nook	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
her	1
a	1
large	1
loaf	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cheese	1
she	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
for	1
some	1
roots	1
and	1
plants	1
which	1
she	1
placed	1
in	1
water	1
and	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
fire	1
she	1
afterwards	1
continued	1
her	1
work	1
whilst	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
appeared	1
busily	1
employed	1
in	1
digging	1
and	1
pulling	1
up	1
roots	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
employed	1
thus	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
joined	1
him	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
cottage	1
together	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
been	1
pensive	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
he	1
assumed	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
air	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
meal	1
was	1
quickly	1
dispatched	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
was	1
again	1
occupied	1
in	1
arranging	1
the	1
cottage	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
walked	1
before	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
youth	1
nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
in	1
beauty	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
excellent	1
creatures	1
one	1
was	1
old	1
with	1
silver	1
hairs	1
and	1
a	1
countenance	1
beaming	1
with	1
benevolence	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
younger	1
was	1
slight	1
and	1
graceful	1
in	1
his	1
figure	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
were	1
moulded	1
with	1
the	1
finest	1
symmetry	1
yet	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
attitude	1
expressed	1
the	1
utmost	1
sadness	1
and	1
despondency	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
with	1
tools	1
different	1
from	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
directed	1
his	1
steps	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
night	1
quickly	1
shut	1
in	1
but	1
to	1
my	1
extreme	1
wonder	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
cottagers	1
had	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
prolonging	1
light	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
tapers	1
and	1
was	1
delighted	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
not	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
i	1
experienced	1
in	1
watching	1
my	1
human	1
neighbours	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
and	1
her	1
companion	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
various	1
occupations	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
again	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
instrument	1
which	1
produced	1
the	1
divine	1

me	1

soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
youth	1
began	1
not	1
to	1
play	1
but	1
to	1
utter	1
sounds	1
that	1
were	1
monotonous	1
and	1
neither	1
resembling	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1

the	1
songs	1
of	1

found	1
that	1

at	1

having	1
been	1
thus	1
occupied	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
extinguished	1

retired	1

i	1
lay	1
on	1
my	1
straw	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
what	1
chiefly	1
struck	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
of	1
these	1
people	1
and	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
but	1
dared	1
not	1
i	1
remembered	1
too	1
well	1
the	1
treatment	1
i	1
had	1
suffered	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
from	1
the	1
barbarous	1
villagers	1
and	1
resolved	1
whatever	1
course	1
of	1
conduct	1
i	1
might	1
hereafter	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
pursue	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
i	1
would	1
remain	1
quietly	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
watching	1
and	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
motives	1
which	1
influenced	1
their	1
actions	1
the	1
cottagers	1
arose	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
arranged	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
prepared	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
departed	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
meal	1
this	1
day	1
was	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
routine	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
preceded	1
it	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
constantly	1
employed	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
in	1
various	1
laborious	1
occupations	1
within	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
whom	1
i	1
soon	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
blind	1
employed	1
his	1
leisure	1
hours	1
on	1
his	1
instrument	1
or	1
in	1
contemplation	1
nothing	1
could	1
exceed	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
younger	1
cottagers	1
exhibited	1
towards	1
their	1
venerable	1
companion	1
they	1
performed	1
towards	1
him	1
every	1
little	1
office	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
duty	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
he	1
rewarded	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
benevolent	1
smiles	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
entirely	1
happy	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
often	1
went	1
apart	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
weep	1
i	1
saw	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
their	1
unhappiness	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
deeply	1
affected	1
by	1
it	1
if	1
such	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
were	1
miserable	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
strange	1
that	1
i	1
an	1
imperfect	1
and	1
solitary	1
being	1
should	1
be	1
wretched	1
yet	1
why	1
were	1
these	1
gentle	1
beings	1
unhappy	1
they	1
possessed	1
a	1
delightful	1
house	1
for	1
such	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
every	1
luxury	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
fire	1
to	1
warm	1
them	1
when	1
chill	1
and	1
delicious	1
viands	1
when	1
hungry	1
they	1
were	1
dressed	1
in	1
excellent	1
clothes	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
one	1
another	1
s	1
company	1
and	1
speech	1
interchanging	1
each	1
day	1
looks	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
kindness	1
what	1
did	1
their	1
tears	1
imply	1
did	1
they	1
really	1
express	1
pain	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
unable	1
to	1
solve	1
these	1
questions	1
but	1
perpetual	1
attention	1
and	1
time	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
many	1
appearances	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
enigmatic	1
a	1
considerable	1
period	1
elapsed	1
before	1
i	1
discovered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
this	1
amiable	1
family	1
it	1
was	1
poverty	1
and	1
they	1
suffered	1
that	1
evil	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
distressing	1
degree	1
their	1
nourishment	1
consisted	1
entirely	1
of	1
the	1
vegetables	1
of	1
their	1
garden	1
and	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
one	1
cow	1
which	1
gave	1
very	1
little	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
when	1
its	1
masters	1
could	1
scarcely	1
procure	1
food	1
to	1
support	1
it	1
they	1
often	1
i	1
believe	1
suffered	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
hunger	1
very	1
poignantly	1
especially	1
the	1
two	1
younger	1
cottagers	1
for	1
several	1
times	1
they	1
placed	1
food	1
before	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
when	1
they	1
reserved	1
none	1
for	1
themselves	1
this	1
trait	1
of	1
kindness	1
moved	1
me	1
sensibly	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
steal	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
store	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
consumption	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
i	1
inflicted	1
pain	1
on	1
the	1
cottagers	1
i	1
abstained	1
and	1
satisfied	1
myself	1
with	1
berries	1
nuts	1
and	1
roots	1
which	1
i	1
gathered	1
from	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
wood	1
i	1
discovered	1
also	1
another	1
means	1
through	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
enabled	1
to	1
assist	1
their	1
labours	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
youth	1
spent	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
each	1
day	1
in	1
collecting	1
wood	1
for	1
the	1
family	1
fire	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
i	1
often	1
took	1
his	1
tools	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
quickly	1
discovered	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
firing	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
consumption	1
of	1
several	1
days	1
i	1
remember	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
i	1
did	1
this	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
appeared	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
on	1
seeing	1
a	1
great	1
pile	1
of	1
wood	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
she	1
uttered	1
some	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
joined	1
her	1
who	1
also	1
expressed	1
surprise	1
i	1
observed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
day	1
but	1
spent	1
it	1
in	1
repairing	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
cultivating	1
the	1
garden	1
by	1
degrees	1
i	1
made	1
a	1
discovery	1
of	1
still	1
greater	1
moment	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
these	1
people	1
possessed	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
communicating	1
their	1
experience	1
and	1
feelings	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
by	1
articulate	1
sounds	1
i	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
spoke	1
sometimes	1
produced	1
pleasure	1
or	1
pain	1
smiles	1
or	1
sadness	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
countenances	1
of	1
the	1
hearers	1
this	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
godlike	1
science	1
and	1
i	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
baffled	1
in	1
every	1
attempt	1
i	1
made	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
their	1
pronunciation	1
was	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
they	1
uttered	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
apparent	1
connection	1
with	1
visible	1
objects	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
discover	1
any	1
clue	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
unravel	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
their	1
reference	1
by	1
great	1
application	1
however	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
remained	1
during	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
several	1
revolutions	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
i	1
discovered	1
the	1
names	1
that	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
familiar	1
objects	1
of	1
discourse	1
i	1
learned	1
and	1
applied	1
the	1
words	1
fire	1
milk	1
bread	1
and	1
wood	1
i	1
learned	1
also	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
themselves	1
the	1
youth	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
several	1
names	1
but	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
had	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
was	1
father	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
called	1
sister	1
or	1
agatha	1
and	1
the	1
youth	1
felix	1
brother	1
or	1
son	1
i	1
cannot	1
describe	1
the	1
delight	1
i	1
felt	1
when	1
i	1
learned	1
the	1
ideas	1
appropriated	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
sounds	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
pronounce	1
them	1
i	1
distinguished	1
several	1
other	1
words	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
as	1
yet	1
to	1
understand	1
or	1
apply	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
good	1
dearest	1
unhappy	1
i	1
spent	1
the	1
winter	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
greatly	1
endeared	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
unhappy	1
i	1
felt	1
depressed	1
when	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
i	1
sympathized	1
in	1
their	1
joys	1
i	1
saw	1
few	1
human	1
beings	1
besides	1
them	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
other	1
happened	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
cottage	1
their	1
harsh	1
manners	1
and	1
rude	1
gait	1
only	1
enhanced	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
superior	1
accomplishments	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
i	1
could	1
perceive	1
often	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
encourage	1
his	1
children	1
as	1
sometimes	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
melancholy	1
he	1
would	1
talk	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
accent	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
goodness	1
that	1
bestowed	1
pleasure	1
even	1
upon	1
me	1
agatha	1
listened	1
with	1
respect	1
her	1
eyes	1
sometimes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
which	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
wipe	1
away	1
unperceived	1
but	1
i	1
generally	1
found	1
that	1
her	1
countenance	1
and	1
tone	1
were	1
more	1
cheerful	1
after	1
having	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
exhortations	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
thus	1
with	1
felix	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
saddest	1
of	1
the	1
group	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
my	1
unpractised	1
senses	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
more	1
deeply	1
than	1
his	1
friends	1
but	1
if	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
more	1
sorrowful	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
more	1
cheerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
i	1
could	1
mention	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
which	1
although	1
slight	1
marked	1
the	1
dispositions	1
of	1
these	1
amiable	1
cottagers	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
poverty	1
and	1
want	1
felix	1
carried	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
the	1
first	1
little	1
white	1
flower	1
that	1
peeped	1
out	1
from	1
beneath	1
the	1
snowy	1
ground	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
risen	1
he	1
cleared	1
away	1
the	1
snow	1
that	1
obstructed	1
her	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
milk	1
house	1
drew	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
wood	1
from	1
the	1
outhouse	1
where	1
to	1
his	1
perpetual	1
astonishment	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
store	1
always	1
replenished	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
believe	1
he	1
worked	1
sometimes	1
for	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
farmer	1
because	1
he	1
often	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
until	1
dinner	1
yet	1
brought	1
no	1
wood	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
worked	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
frosty	1
season	1
he	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
agatha	1
this	1
reading	1
had	1
puzzled	1
me	1
extremely	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
uttered	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sounds	1
when	1
he	1
read	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
talked	1
i	1
conjectured	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
paper	1
signs	1
for	1
speech	1
which	1
he	1
understood	1
and	1
i	1
ardently	1
longed	1
to	1
comprehend	1
these	1
also	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
that	1
possible	1
when	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
understand	1
the	1
sounds	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
stood	1
as	1
signs	1
i	1
improved	1
however	1
sensibly	1
in	1
this	1
science	1
but	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
follow	1
up	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
conversation	1
although	1
i	1
applied	1
my	1
whole	1
mind	1
to	1
the	1
endeavour	1
for	1
i	1
easily	1
perceived	1
that	1
although	1
i	1
eagerly	1
longed	1
to	1
discover	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
cottagers	1
i	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
until	1
i	1
had	1
first	1
become	1
master	1
of	1
their	1
language	1
which	1
knowledge	1
might	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
overlook	1
the	1
deformity	1
of	1
my	1
figure	1
for	1
with	1
this	1
also	1
the	1
contrast	1
perpetually	1
presented	1
to	1
my	1
eyes	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
acquainted	1
i	1
had	1
admired	1
the	1
perfect	1
forms	1
of	1
my	1
cottagers	1
their	1
grace	1
beauty	1
and	1
delicate	1
complexions	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
i	1
terrified	1
when	1
i	1
viewed	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
transparent	1
pool	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
started	1
back	1
unable	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
i	1
who	1
was	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
became	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
the	1
monster	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
i	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
bitterest	1
sensations	1
of	1
despondence	1
and	1
mortification	1
alas	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
entirely	1
know	1
the	1
fatal	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
miserable	1
deformity	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
warmer	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
longer	1
the	1
snow	1
vanished	1
and	1
i	1
beheld	1
the	1
bare	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
earth	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
felix	1
was	1
more	1
employed	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
moving	1
indications	1
of	1
impending	1
famine	1
disappeared	1
their	1
food	1
as	1
i	1
afterwards	1
found	1
was	1
coarse	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
wholesome	1
and	1
they	1
procured	1
a	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
it	1
several	1
new	1
kinds	1
of	1
plants	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
which	1
they	1
dressed	1
and	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
comfort	1
increased	1
daily	1

the	1
season	1
advanced	1
the	1

man	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
son	1

each	1
day	1
at	1
noon	1
when	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
rain	1
as	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
when	1
the	1
heavens	1
poured	1
forth	1
its	1
waters	1
this	1
frequently	1
took	1
place	1
but	1
a	1
high	1
wind	1
quickly	1
dried	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
season	1
became	1
far	1
more	1
pleasant	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
was	1
uniform	1
during	1
the	1
morning	1
i	1
attended	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dispersed	1
in	1
various	1
occupations	1
i	1
slept	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
observing	1
my	1
friends	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
rest	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
moon	1
or	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
star	1
light	1
i	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
collected	1
my	1
own	1
food	1
and	1
fuel	1
for	1
the	1
cottage	1
when	1
i	1
returned	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
i	1
cleared	1
their	1
path	1
from	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
performed	1
those	1
offices	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
done	1
by	1
felix	1
i	1
afterwards	1
found	1
that	1
these	1
labours	1
performed	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand	1
greatly	1
astonished	1
them	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
i	1
heard	1
them	1
on	1
these	1
occasions	1
utter	1
the	1
words	1
good	1
spirit	1
wonderful	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
understand	1
the	1
signification	1
of	1
these	1
terms	1
my	1
thoughts	1
now	1
became	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
i	1
longed	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
motives	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
these	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
i	1
was	1
inquisitive	1
to	1
know	1
why	1
felix	1
appeared	1
so	1
miserable	1
and	1
agatha	1
so	1
sad	1
i	1
thought	1
foolish	1
wretch	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
restore	1
happiness	1
to	1
these	1
deserving	1
people	1
when	1
i	1
slept	1
or	1
was	1
absent	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
venerable	1
blind	1
father	1
the	1
gentle	1
agatha	1
and	1
the	1
excellent	1
felix	1
flitted	1
before	1
me	1
i	1
looked	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
superior	1
beings	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
arbiters	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
destiny	1
i	1
formed	1
in	1
my	1
imagination	1
a	1
thousand	1
pictures	1
of	1
presenting	1
myself	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
reception	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
disgusted	1
until	1
by	1
my	1
gentle	1
demeanour	1
and	1
conciliating	1
words	1
i	1
should	1
first	1
win	1
their	1
favour	1
and	1
afterwards	1
their	1
love	1
these	1
thoughts	1
exhilarated	1
me	1
and	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
apply	1
with	1
fresh	1
ardour	1
to	1
the	1
acquiring	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
language	1
my	1
organs	1
were	1
indeed	1
harsh	1
but	1
supple	1
and	1
although	1
my	1
voice	1
was	1
very	1
unlike	1
the	1
soft	1
music	1
of	1
their	1
tones	1
yet	1
i	1
pronounced	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
i	1
understood	1
with	1
tolerable	1
ease	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
the	1
lap	1
dog	1
yet	1
surely	1
the	1
gentle	1
ass	1
whose	1
intentions	1
were	1
affectionate	1
although	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
rude	1
deserved	1
better	1
treatment	1
than	1
blows	1
and	1
execration	1
the	1
pleasant	1
showers	1
and	1
genial	1
warmth	1
of	1
spring	1
greatly	1
altered	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1

who	1
before	1
this	1
change	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1

in	1
caves	1
dispersed	1
themselves	1
and	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
various	1
arts	1
of	1
cultivation	1
the	1
birds	1
sang	1
in	1
more	1
cheerful	1
notes	1

so	1
short	1

and	1
unwholesome	1
my	1
spirits	1
were	1
elevated	1
by	1
the	1
enchanting	1
appearance	1
of	1
nature	1
the	1

blotted	1

now	1
hasten	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
moving	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
i	1
shall	1
relate	1
events	1
that	1
impressed	1
me	1
with	1
feelings	1

from	1
what	1

spring	1
advanced	1
rapidly	1
the	1
weather	1
became	1
fine	1
and	1
the	1
skies	1
cloudless	1
it	1
surprised	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
before	1
was	1
desert	1
and	1
gloomy	1
should	1
now	1
bloom	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
flowers	1
and	1
verdure	1
my	1
senses	1
were	1
gratified	1
and	1
refreshed	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
scents	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
sights	1
of	1
beauty	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
when	1
my	1
cottagers	1
periodically	1
rested	1
from	1
labour	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
played	1
on	1
his	1
guitar	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
observed	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
felix	1
was	1
melancholy	1
beyond	1
expression	1
he	1
sighed	1
frequently	1
and	1
once	1
his	1
father	1
paused	1
in	1
his	1
music	1
and	1
i	1
conjectured	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
inquired	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
s	1
sorrow	1
felix	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
cheerful	1
accent	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
recommencing	1
his	1
music	1
when	1
someone	1
tapped	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
lady	1
on	1
horseback	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
country	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
guide	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
suit	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
black	1
veil	1
agatha	1
asked	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
only	1
replied	1
by	1
pronouncing	1
in	1
a	1
sweet	1
accent	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
felix	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
musical	1
but	1
unlike	1
that	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
word	1
felix	1
came	1
up	1
hastily	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
veil	1
and	1
i	1
beheld	1
a	1
countenance	1
of	1
angelic	1
beauty	1
and	1
expression	1
her	1
hair	1
of	1
a	1
shining	1
raven	1
black	1
and	1
curiously	1
braided	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
dark	1
but	1
gentle	1
although	1
animated	1
her	1
features	1
of	1
a	1
regular	1
proportion	1
and	1
her	1
complexion	1
wondrously	1
fair	1
each	1
cheek	1
tinged	1
with	1
a	1
lovely	1
pink	1
felix	1
seemed	1
ravished	1
with	1
delight	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
every	1
trait	1
of	1
sorrow	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
instantly	1
expressed	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
ecstatic	1
joy	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
capable	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
as	1
his	1
cheek	1
flushed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
thought	1
him	1
as	1
beautiful	1
as	1
the	1
stranger	1
she	1
appeared	1
affected	1
by	1
different	1
feelings	1
wiping	1
a	1
few	1
tears	1
from	1
her	1
lovely	1
eyes	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
felix	1
who	1
kissed	1
it	1
rapturously	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
distinguish	1
his	1
sweet	1
arabian	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
understand	1
him	1
but	1
smiled	1
he	1
assisted	1
her	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
dismissing	1
her	1
guide	1
conducted	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
some	1
conversation	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
stranger	1
knelt	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
s	1
feet	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand	1
but	1
he	1
raised	1
her	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
affectionately	1
i	1
soon	1
perceived	1
that	1
although	1
the	1
stranger	1
uttered	1
articulate	1
sounds	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
language	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
she	1
was	1
neither	1
understood	1
by	1
nor	1
herself	1
understood	1
the	1
cottagers	1
they	1
made	1
many	1
signs	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
but	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
presence	1
diffused	1
gladness	1
through	1
the	1
cottage	1
dispelling	1
their	1
sorrow	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
dissipates	1
the	1
morning	1
mists	1
felix	1
seemed	1
peculiarly	1
happy	1
and	1
with	1
smiles	1
of	1
delight	1
welcomed	1
his	1
arabian	1
agatha	1
the	1
ever	1
gentle	1
agatha	1
kissed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
lovely	1
stranger	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
made	1
signs	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sorrowful	1
until	1
she	1
came	1
some	1
hours	1
passed	1
thus	1
while	1
they	1
by	1
their	1
countenances	1
expressed	1
joy	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
comprehend	1
presently	1
i	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
recurrence	1
of	1
some	1
sound	1
which	1
the	1
stranger	1
repeated	1
after	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
learn	1
their	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
instantly	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
end	1
the	1
stranger	1
learned	1
about	1
twenty	1
words	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
lesson	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
indeed	1
were	1
those	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
understood	1
but	1
i	1
profited	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
as	1
night	1
came	1
on	1
agatha	1
and	1
the	1
arabian	1
retired	1
early	1
when	1
they	1
separated	1
felix	1
kissed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
said	1
good	1
night	1
sweet	1
safie	1
he	1
sat	1
up	1
much	1
longer	1
conversing	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
frequent	1
repetition	1
of	1
her	1
name	1
i	1
conjectured	1
that	1
their	1
lovely	1
guest	1
was	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
i	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
bent	1
every	1
faculty	1
towards	1
that	1
purpose	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
utterly	1
impossible	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
felix	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
work	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
usual	1
occupations	1
of	1
agatha	1
were	1
finished	1
the	1
arabian	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
guitar	1
played	1
some	1
airs	1
so	1
entrancingly	1
beautiful	1
that	1
they	1
at	1
once	1
drew	1
tears	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
delight	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
she	1
sang	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
flowed	1
in	1
a	1
rich	1
cadence	1
swelling	1
or	1
dying	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
nightingale	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
guitar	1
to	1
agatha	1
who	1
at	1
first	1
declined	1
it	1
she	1
played	1
a	1
simple	1
air	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
accompanied	1
it	1
in	1
sweet	1
accents	1
but	1
unlike	1
the	1
wondrous	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
appeared	1
enraptured	1
and	1
said	1
some	1
words	1
which	1
agatha	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
safie	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
that	1
she	1
bestowed	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight	1
by	1
her	1
music	1
the	1
days	1
now	1
passed	1
as	1
peaceably	1
as	1
before	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
alteration	1
that	1
joy	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
of	1
sadness	1
in	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
safie	1
was	1
always	1
gay	1
and	1
happy	1
she	1
and	1
i	1
improved	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
language	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
comprehend	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
uttered	1
by	1
my	1
protectors	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
also	1
the	1
black	1
ground	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
herbage	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
banks	1
interspersed	1
with	1
innumerable	1
flowers	1
sweet	1
to	1
the	1
scent	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
stars	1
of	1
pale	1
radiance	1
among	1
the	1
moonlight	1
woods	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
warmer	1
the	1
nights	1
clear	1
and	1
balmy	1
and	1
my	1
nocturnal	1
rambles	1
were	1
an	1
extreme	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
considerably	1
shortened	1
by	1
the	1
late	1
setting	1
and	1
early	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
i	1
never	1
ventured	1
abroad	1
during	1
daylight	1
fearful	1
of	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
treatment	1
i	1
had	1
formerly	1
endured	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
which	1
i	1
entered	1
my	1
days	1
were	1
spent	1
in	1
close	1
attention	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
more	1
speedily	1
master	1
the	1
language	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
boast	1
that	1
i	1
improved	1
more	1
rapidly	1
than	1
the	1
arabian	1
who	1
understood	1
very	1
little	1
and	1
conversed	1
in	1
broken	1
accents	1
whilst	1
i	1
comprehended	1
and	1
could	1
imitate	1
almost	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
spoken	1
while	1
i	1
improved	1
in	1
speech	1
i	1
also	1
learned	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
letters	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
taught	1
to	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
this	1
opened	1
before	1
me	1
a	1
wide	1
field	1
for	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight	1
the	1
book	1

i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
had	1
not	1
felix	1
in	1
reading	1
it	1
given	1
very	1
minute	1
explanations	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
this	1
work	1
he	1
said	1
because	1
the	1
declamatory	1
style	1
was	1
framed	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
eastern	1
authors	1
through	1
this	1
work	1
i	1
obtained	1
a	1
cursory	1
knowledge	1
of	1
history	1
and	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
empires	1
at	1
present	1
existing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
an	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
manners	1
governments	1
and	1
religions	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
slothful	1
asiatics	1
of	1
the	1
stupendous	1
genius	1
and	1
mental	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
grecians	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
and	1
wonderful	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
romans	1
of	1
their	1
subsequent	1
degenerating	1
of	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
that	1
mighty	1
empire	1
of	1
chivalry	1
christianity	1
and	1
kings	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
american	1
hemisphere	1
and	1
wept	1
with	1
safie	1
over	1
the	1
hapless	1
fate	1
of	1
its	1
original	1
inhabitants	1
these	1
wonderful	1
narrations	1
inspired	1
me	1
with	1
strange	1
feelings	1
was	1
man	1
indeed	1
at	1
once	1
so	1
powerful	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
magnificent	1
yet	1
so	1
vicious	1
and	1
base	1
he	1
appeared	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
a	1
mere	1
scion	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
principle	1
and	1
at	1
another	1
as	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
conceived	1
of	1
noble	1
and	1
godlike	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
virtuous	1
man	1
appeared	1
the	1
highest	1
honour	1
that	1
can	1
befall	1
a	1
sensitive	1
being	1
to	1
be	1
base	1
and	1
vicious	1
as	1
many	1
on	1
record	1
have	1
been	1
appeared	1
the	1
lowest	1
degradation	1
a	1
condition	1
more	1
abject	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
mole	1
or	1
harmless	1
worm	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
how	1
one	1
man	1
could	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
murder	1
his	1
fellow	1
or	1
even	1
why	1
there	1
were	1
laws	1
and	1
governments	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
details	1
of	1
vice	1
and	1
bloodshed	1
my	1
wonder	1
ceased	1
and	1
i	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
disgust	1
and	1
loathing	1
every	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
now	1
opened	1
new	1
wonders	1
to	1
me	1
while	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
instructions	1
which	1
felix	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
the	1
arabian	1
the	1
strange	1
system	1
of	1
human	1
society	1
was	1
explained	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
property	1
of	1
immense	1
wealth	1
and	1
squalid	1
poverty	1
of	1
rank	1
descent	1
and	1
noble	1
blood	1
the	1
words	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
turn	1
towards	1
myself	1
i	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
possessions	1
most	1
esteemed	1
by	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
were	1
high	1
and	1
unsullied	1
descent	1
united	1
with	1
riches	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
be	1
respected	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
advantages	1
but	1
without	1
either	1
he	1
was	1
considered	1
except	1
in	1
very	1
rare	1
instances	1
as	1
a	1
vagabond	1
and	1
a	1
slave	1
doomed	1
to	1
waste	1
his	1
powers	1
for	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
the	1
chosen	1
few	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
i	1
of	1
my	1
creation	1
and	1
creator	1
i	1
was	1
absolutely	1
ignorant	1
but	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
possessed	1
no	1
money	1
no	1
friends	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
property	1
i	1
was	1
besides	1
endued	1
with	1
a	1
figure	1
hideously	1
deformed	1
and	1
loathsome	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
nature	1
as	1
man	1
i	1
was	1
more	1
agile	1
than	1
they	1
and	1
could	1
subsist	1
upon	1
coarser	1
diet	1
i	1
bore	1
the	1
extremes	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
cold	1
with	1
less	1
injury	1
to	1
my	1
frame	1
my	1
stature	1
far	1
exceeded	1
theirs	1
when	1
i	1
looked	1
around	1
i	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
of	1
none	1
like	1
me	1
was	1
i	1
then	1
a	1
monster	1
a	1
blot	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
men	1
fled	1
and	1
whom	1
all	1
men	1
disowned	1
i	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
agony	1
that	1
these	1
reflections	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
dispel	1
them	1
but	1
sorrow	1
only	1
increased	1
with	1
knowledge	1
oh	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
forever	1
remained	1
in	1
my	1
native	1
wood	1
nor	1
known	1
nor	1
felt	1
beyond	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
hunger	1
thirst	1
and	1
heat	1
of	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
nature	1
is	1
knowledge	1
it	1
clings	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
once	1
seized	1
on	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
lichen	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
i	1
wished	1
sometimes	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
all	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
but	1
i	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
means	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
death	1
a	1
state	1
which	1
i	1
feared	1
yet	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
i	1
admired	1
virtue	1
and	1
good	1
feelings	1
and	1
loved	1
the	1
gentle	1
manners	1
and	1
amiable	1
qualities	1
of	1
my	1
cottagers	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
intercourse	1
with	1
them	1
except	1
through	1
means	1
which	1
i	1
obtained	1
by	1
stealth	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
unseen	1
and	1
unknown	1
and	1
which	1
rather	1
increased	1
than	1
satisfied	1
the	1
desire	1
i	1
had	1
of	1
becoming	1
one	1
among	1
my	1
fellows	1
the	1
gentle	1
words	1
of	1
agatha	1
and	1
the	1
animated	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
charming	1
arabian	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
mild	1
exhortations	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
lively	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
loved	1
felix	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
miserable	1
unhappy	1
wretch	1
other	1
lessons	1
were	1
impressed	1
upon	1
me	1
even	1
more	1
deeply	1
i	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
sexes	1
and	1
the	1
birth	1
and	1
growth	1
of	1
children	1
how	1
the	1
father	1
doted	1
on	1
the	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
infant	1
and	1
the	1
lively	1
sallies	1
of	1
the	1
older	1
child	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
were	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
precious	1
charge	1
how	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
youth	1
expanded	1
and	1
gained	1
knowledge	1
of	1
brother	1
sister	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
relationships	1
which	1
bind	1
one	1
human	1
being	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
mutual	1
bonds	1
but	1
where	1
were	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
no	1
father	1
had	1
watched	1
my	1
infant	1
days	1
no	1
mother	1
had	1
blessed	1
me	1
with	1
smiles	1
and	1
caresses	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
my	1
past	1
life	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
blot	1
a	1
blind	1
vacancy	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
distinguished	1
nothing	1
from	1
my	1
earliest	1
remembrance	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
i	1
then	1
was	1
in	1
height	1
and	1
proportion	1
i	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
a	1
being	1
resembling	1
me	1
or	1
who	1
claimed	1
any	1
intercourse	1
with	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
i	1
the	1
question	1
again	1
recurred	1
to	1
be	1
answered	1
only	1
with	1
groans	1
i	1
will	1
soon	1
explain	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
feelings	1
tended	1
but	1
allow	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
cottagers	1
whose	1
story	1
excited	1
in	1
me	1
such	1
various	1
feelings	1
of	1
indignation	1
delight	1
and	1
wonder	1
but	1
which	1
all	1
terminated	1
in	1
additional	1
love	1
and	1
reverence	1
for	1
my	1
protectors	1
for	1
so	1
i	1
loved	1
in	1
an	1
innocent	1
half	1
painful	1
self	1
deceit	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
chapter	1
14	1
some	1
time	1
elapsed	1
before	1
i	1
learned	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
impress	1
itself	1
deeply	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
unfolding	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
circumstances	1
each	1
interesting	1
and	1
wonderful	1
to	1
one	1
so	1
utterly	1
inexperienced	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
de	1
lacey	1
he	1
was	1
descended	1
from	1
a	1
good	1
family	1
in	1
france	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
affluence	1
respected	1
by	1
his	1
superiors	1
and	1
beloved	1
by	1
his	1
equals	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
bred	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
and	1
agatha	1
had	1
ranked	1
with	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
distinction	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
before	1
my	1
arrival	1
they	1
had	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
luxurious	1
city	1
called	1
paris	1
surrounded	1
by	1
friends	1
and	1
possessed	1
of	1
every	1
enjoyment	1
which	1
virtue	1
refinement	1
of	1
intellect	1
or	1
taste	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
moderate	1
fortune	1
could	1
afford	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
safie	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
ruin	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
turkish	1
merchant	1
and	1
had	1
inhabited	1
paris	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
when	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
learn	1
he	1
became	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
prison	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
safie	1
arrived	1
from	1
constantinople	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
tried	1
and	1
condemned	1
to	1
death	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
his	1
sentence	1
was	1
very	1
flagrant	1
all	1
paris	1
was	1
indignant	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
judged	1
that	1
his	1
religion	1
and	1
wealth	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
crime	1
alleged	1
against	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
condemnation	1
felix	1
had	1
accidentally	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
trial	1
his	1
horror	1
and	1
indignation	1
were	1
uncontrollable	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
he	1
made	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
a	1
solemn	1
vow	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
looked	1
around	1
for	1
the	1
means	1
after	1
many	1
fruitless	1
attempts	1
to	1
gain	1
admittance	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
strongly	1
grated	1
window	1
in	1
an	1
unguarded	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
which	1
lighted	1
the	1
dungeon	1
of	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
muhammadan	1
who	1
loaded	1
with	1
chains	1
waited	1
in	1
despair	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
barbarous	1
sentence	1
felix	1
visited	1
the	1
grate	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
prisoner	1
his	1
intentions	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
the	1
turk	1
amazed	1
and	1
delighted	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
kindle	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
his	1
deliverer	1
by	1
promises	1
of	1
reward	1
and	1
wealth	1
felix	1
rejected	1
his	1
offers	1
with	1
contempt	1
yet	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
lovely	1
safie	1
who	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
who	1
by	1
her	1
gestures	1
expressed	1
her	1
lively	1
gratitude	1
the	1
youth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
owning	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
captive	1
possessed	1
a	1
treasure	1
which	1
would	1
fully	1
reward	1
his	1
toil	1
and	1
hazard	1
the	1
turk	1
quickly	1
perceived	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
had	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
felix	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
secure	1
him	1
more	1
entirely	1
in	1
his	1
interests	1
by	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
marriage	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
conveyed	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
felix	1
was	1
too	1
delicate	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
offer	1
yet	1
he	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
during	1
the	1
ensuing	1
days	1
while	1
the	1
preparations	1
were	1
going	1
forward	1
for	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
felix	1
was	1
warmed	1
by	1
several	1
letters	1
that	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
this	1
lovely	1
girl	1
who	1
found	1
means	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
thoughts	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
who	1
understood	1
french	1
she	1
thanked	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ardent	1
terms	1
for	1
his	1
intended	1
services	1
towards	1
her	1
parent	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
gently	1
deplored	1
her	1
own	1
fate	1
i	1
have	1
copies	1
of	1
these	1
letters	1
for	1
i	1
found	1
means	1
during	1
my	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
hovel	1
to	1
procure	1
the	1
implements	1
of	1
writing	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
felix	1
or	1
agatha	1
before	1
i	1
depart	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
they	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
my	1
tale	1
but	1
at	1
present	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
already	1
far	1
declined	1
i	1
shall	1
only	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
safie	1
related	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
a	1
christian	1
arab	1
seized	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
slave	1
by	1
the	1
turks	1
recommended	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
she	1
had	1
won	1

at	1

passing	1
into	1
some	1

until	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1

in	1

of	1
the	1

exhibited	1
towards	1
him	1
the	1
simplest	1

conversed	1
with	1
one	1

through	1
the	1

sometimes	1
with	1
the	1

to	1
him	1
the	1
divine	1
airs	1
of	1

allowed	1
this	1
intimacy	1
to	1

encouraged	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1

in	1
his	1

loathed	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
his	1

he	1
feared	1
the	1
resentment	1
of	1
felix	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
appear	1
lukewarm	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
power	1

the	1

the	1

no	1

secretly	1
to	1
take	1
his	1

with	1
him	1
when	1

facilitated	1
by	1
the	1

from	1

were	1
greatly	1
enraged	1
at	1
the	1

of	1

de	1
lacey	1

agatha	1
were	1
thrown	1
into	1
prison	1
the	1
news	1
reached	1

roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
dream	1
of	1
pleasure	1
his	1
blind	1
and	1
aged	1
father	1
and	1
his	1

in	1

the	1
free	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
this	1
idea	1
was	1
torture	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
quickly	1
arranged	1
with	1
the	1
turk	1
that	1
if	1

should	1
find	1
a	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
for	1
escape	1
before	1

remain	1
as	1
a	1
boarder	1
at	1
a	1
convent	1
at	1
leghorn	1
and	1
then	1
quitting	1
the	1
lovely	1
arabian	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
paris	1
and	1
delivered	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
hoping	1
to	1
free	1
de	1
lacey	1
and	1
agatha	1
by	1
this	1
proceeding	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
succeed	1
they	1
remained	1
confined	1
for	1
five	1
months	1
before	1
the	1
trial	1
took	1
place	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
deprived	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
fortune	1
and	1
condemned	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
perpetual	1
exile	1
from	1
their	1
native	1
country	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
miserable	1
asylum	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
germany	1
where	1
i	1
discovered	1
them	1
felix	1
soon	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
treacherous	1
turk	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
endured	1
such	1
unheard	1
of	1
oppression	1
on	1
discovering	1
that	1
his	1
deliverer	1
was	1
thus	1
reduced	1
to	1
poverty	1
and	1
ruin	1
became	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
good	1
feeling	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
had	1
quitted	1
italy	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
insultingly	1
sending	1
felix	1
a	1
pittance	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
aid	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
some	1
plan	1
of	1
future	1
maintenance	1
such	1
were	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
preyed	1
on	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
felix	1
and	1
rendered	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
endured	1
poverty	1
and	1
while	1
this	1
distress	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
meed	1
of	1
his	1
virtue	1
he	1
gloried	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
the	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
the	1
turk	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
beloved	1
safie	1
were	1
misfortunes	1
more	1
bitter	1
and	1
irreparable	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
arabian	1
now	1
infused	1
new	1
life	1
into	1
his	1
soul	1
when	1
the	1
news	1
reached	1
leghorn	1
that	1
felix	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
rank	1
the	1
merchant	1
commanded	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
but	1
to	1
prepare	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
native	1
country	1
the	1
generous	1
nature	1
of	1
safie	1
was	1
outraged	1
by	1
this	1
command	1
she	1
attempted	1
to	1
expostulate	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
but	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
angrily	1
reiterating	1
his	1
tyrannical	1
mandate	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
turk	1
entered	1
his	1
daughter	1
s	1
apartment	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
hastily	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
his	1
residence	1
at	1
leghorn	1
had	1
been	1
divulged	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
speedily	1
be	1
delivered	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
french	1
government	1
he	1
had	1
consequently	1
hired	1
a	1
vessel	1
to	1
convey	1
him	1
to	1
constantinople	1
for	1
which	1
city	1
he	1
should	1
sail	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
daughter	1
under	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
confidential	1
servant	1
to	1
follow	1
at	1
her	1
leisure	1
with	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived	1
at	1
leghorn	1
when	1
alone	1
safie	1
resolved	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
conduct	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
become	1
her	1
to	1
pursue	1
in	1
this	1
emergency	1
a	1
residence	1
in	1
turkey	1
was	1
abhorrent	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
religion	1
and	1
her	1
feelings	1
were	1
alike	1
averse	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
some	1
papers	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
which	1
fell	1
into	1
her	1
hands	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
exile	1
of	1
her	1
lover	1
and	1
learnt	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
then	1
resided	1
she	1
hesitated	1
some	1
time	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
formed	1
her	1
determination	1
taking	1
with	1
her	1
some	1
jewels	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
she	1
quitted	1
italy	1
with	1
an	1
attendant	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
leghorn	1
but	1
who	1
understood	1
the	1
common	1
language	1
of	1
turkey	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
germany	1
she	1
arrived	1
in	1
safety	1
at	1
a	1
town	1
about	1
twenty	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
de	1
lacey	1
when	1
her	1
attendant	1
fell	1
dangerously	1
ill	1
safie	1
nursed	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
devoted	1
affection	1
but	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
died	1
and	1
the	1
arabian	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
utterly	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
customs	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
she	1
fell	1
however	1
into	1
good	1
hands	1
the	1
italian	1
had	1
mentioned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
spot	1
for	1
which	1

after	1
her	1
death	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1

chapter	1
15	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
cottagers	1
it	1
impressed	1
me	1
deeply	1
i	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
social	1
life	1
which	1
it	1
developed	1
to	1
admire	1
their	1
virtues	1
and	1
to	1
deprecate	1
the	1
vices	1
of	1
mankind	1
as	1
yet	1
i	1
looked	1
upon	1
crime	1
as	1
a	1
distant	1
evil	1
benevolence	1
and	1
generosity	1
were	1
ever	1
present	1
before	1
me	1
inciting	1
within	1
me	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
actor	1
in	1
the	1
busy	1
scene	1
where	1
so	1
many	1
admirable	1
qualities	1
were	1
called	1
forth	1
and	1
displayed	1
but	1
in	1
giving	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
my	1
intellect	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
omit	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
august	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
one	1
night	1
during	1
my	1
accustomed	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
wood	1
where	1
i	1
collected	1
my	1
own	1
food	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
firing	1
for	1
my	1
protectors	1
i	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
a	1
leathern	1
portmanteau	1
containing	1
several	1
articles	1
of	1
dress	1
and	1
some	1
books	1
i	1
eagerly	1
seized	1
the	1
prize	1
and	1
returned	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
hovel	1
fortunately	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
acquired	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
they	1
consisted	1
of	1
paradise	1
lost	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
plutarch	1
s	1
lives	1
and	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
werter	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
these	1
treasures	1
gave	1
me	1
extreme	1
delight	1
i	1
now	1
continually	1
studied	1
and	1
exercised	1
my	1
mind	1
upon	1
these	1
histories	1
whilst	1
my	1
friends	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
their	1
ordinary	1
occupations	1
i	1
can	1
hardly	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
these	1
books	1
they	1
produced	1
in	1
me	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
new	1
images	1
and	1
feelings	1
that	1
sometimes	1
raised	1
me	1
to	1
ecstasy	1
but	1
more	1
frequently	1
sunk	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
lowest	1
dejection	1
in	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
werter	1
besides	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
its	1
simple	1
and	1
affecting	1
story	1
so	1
many	1
opinions	1
are	1
canvassed	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
lights	1
thrown	1
upon	1
what	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
obscure	1
subjects	1
that	1
i	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
never	1
ending	1
source	1
of	1
speculation	1
and	1
astonishment	1
the	1
gentle	1
and	1
domestic	1
manners	1
it	1
described	1
combined	1
with	1
lofty	1
sentiments	1
and	1
feelings	1
which	1
had	1
for	1
their	1
object	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
self	1
accorded	1
well	1
with	1
my	1
experience	1
among	1
my	1
protectors	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
wants	1
which	1
were	1
forever	1
alive	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
bosom	1
but	1
i	1
thought	1
werter	1
himself	1
a	1
more	1
divine	1
being	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
beheld	1
or	1
imagined	1
his	1
character	1
contained	1
no	1
pretension	1
but	1
it	1
sank	1
deep	1
the	1
disquisitions	1
upon	1
death	1
and	1
suicide	1
were	1
calculated	1
to	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
wonder	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
yet	1
i	1
inclined	1
towards	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
the	1
hero	1
whose	1
extinction	1
i	1
wept	1
without	1
precisely	1
understanding	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
read	1
however	1
i	1
applied	1
much	1
personally	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
feelings	1
and	1
condition	1
i	1
found	1

at	1
the	1

time	1
strangely	1
unlike	1
to	1
the	1
beings	1
concerning	1
whom	1
i	1
read	1
and	1
to	1
whose	1
conversation	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
listener	1
i	1
sympathized	1
with	1
and	1
partly	1
understood	1
them	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
unformed	1
in	1
mind	1
i	1
was	1
dependent	1
on	1
none	1
and	1
related	1
to	1
none	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
was	1
free	1

there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1

my	1
annihilation	1

these	1
questions	1

recurred	1

i	1
was	1
unable	1

solve	1
them	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
plutarch	1
s	1
lives	1
which	1
i	1
possessed	1
contained	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
founders	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
republics	1
this	1
book	1
had	1
a	1
far	1
different	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
werter	1
i	1
learned	1
from	1
werter	1
s	1
imaginations	1
despondency	1
and	1
gloom	1
but	1
plutarch	1
taught	1
me	1
high	1
thoughts	1
he	1
elevated	1
me	1
above	1
the	1
wretched	1
sphere	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
reflections	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
past	1
ages	1
many	1
things	1
i	1
read	1
surpassed	1
my	1
understanding	1
and	1
experience	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
confused	1
knowledge	1
of	1
kingdoms	1
wide	1
extents	1
of	1
country	1
mighty	1
rivers	1
and	1
boundless	1
seas	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
towns	1
and	1
large	1
assemblages	1
of	1
men	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
school	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
studied	1
human	1
nature	1
but	1
this	1
book	1
developed	1
new	1
and	1
mightier	1
scenes	1
of	1
action	1
i	1
read	1
of	1
men	1
concerned	1
in	1
public	1
affairs	1
governing	1
or	1
massacring	1
their	1
species	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
ardour	1
for	1
virtue	1
rise	1
within	1
me	1
and	1
abhorrence	1
for	1
vice	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
i	1
understood	1
the	1
signification	1
of	1
those	1
terms	1
relative	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
i	1
applied	1
them	1
to	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pain	1
alone	1
induced	1
by	1
these	1
feelings	1
i	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
led	1
to	1
admire	1
peaceable	1
lawgivers	1
numa	1
solon	1
and	1
lycurgus	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
romulus	1
and	1
theseus	1
the	1
patriarchal	1
lives	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
caused	1
these	1
impressions	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
firm	1
hold	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
perhaps	1
if	1
my	1
first	1
introduction	1
to	1
humanity	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
burning	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
slaughter	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
imbued	1
with	1
different	1
sensations	1
but	1
paradise	1
lost	1
excited	1
different	1
and	1
far	1
deeper	1
emotions	1
i	1
read	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
other	1
volumes	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
as	1
a	1
true	1
history	1
it	1
moved	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
awe	1
that	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
an	1
omnipotent	1
god	1
warring	1
with	1
his	1
creatures	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
exciting	1
i	1
often	1
referred	1
the	1
several	1
situations	1
as	1
their	1
similarity	1
struck	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
like	1
adam	1
i	1
was	1
apparently	1
united	1
by	1
no	1
link	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
being	1
in	1
existence	1
but	1
his	1
state	1
was	1
far	1
different	1
from	1
mine	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
respect	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
god	1
a	1
perfect	1
creature	1
happy	1
and	1
prosperous	1
guarded	1
by	1
the	1
especial	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
creator	1
he	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
and	1
acquire	1
knowledge	1
from	1
beings	1
of	1
a	1
superior	1
nature	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
wretched	1
helpless	1
and	1
alone	1
many	1
times	1
i	1
considered	1
satan	1
as	1
the	1
fitter	1
emblem	1
of	1
my	1
condition	1
for	1
often	1
like	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
viewed	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
the	1
bitter	1
gall	1
of	1
envy	1
rose	1
within	1
me	1
another	1
circumstance	1
strengthened	1
and	1
confirmed	1
these	1
feelings	1
soon	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
in	1
the	1
hovel	1
i	1
discovered	1
some	1
papers	1
in	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
your	1
laboratory	1
at	1
first	1
i	1
had	1
neglected	1
them	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
decipher	1
the	1
characters	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
written	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
study	1
them	1
with	1
diligence	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
journal	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
months	1
that	1
preceded	1
my	1
creation	1
you	1
minutely	1
described	1
in	1
these	1
papers	1
every	1
step	1
you	1
took	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
your	1
work	1
this	1
history	1
was	1
mingled	1
with	1
accounts	1
of	1
domestic	1
occurrences	1
you	1
doubtless	1
recollect	1
these	1
papers	1
here	1
they	1
are	1
everything	1
is	1
related	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
bears	1
reference	1
to	1
my	1
accursed	1
origin	1
the	1
whole	1
detail	1
of	1
that	1
series	1
of	1
disgusting	1
circumstances	1
which	1
produced	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
minutest	1
description	1
of	1
my	1
odious	1
and	1
loathsome	1
person	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
language	1
which	1
painted	1
your	1
own	1
horrors	1
and	1
rendered	1
mine	1
indelible	1
i	1
sickened	1
as	1
i	1
read	1
hateful	1
day	1
when	1
i	1
received	1
life	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
agony	1
accursed	1
creator	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
form	1
a	1
monster	1
so	1
hideous	1
that	1
even	1
you	1
turned	1
from	1
me	1
in	1
disgust	1
god	1
in	1
pity	1
made	1
man	1
beautiful	1
and	1
alluring	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
image	1
but	1
my	1
form	1
is	1
a	1
filthy	1
type	1
of	1
yours	1
more	1
horrid	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
resemblance	1
satan	1
had	1
his	1
companions	1
fellow	1
devils	1
to	1
admire	1
and	1
encourage	1
him	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
solitary	1
and	1
abhorred	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
reflections	1
of	1
my	1
hours	1
of	1
despondency	1
and	1
solitude	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
contemplated	1
the	1
virtues	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
their	1
amiable	1
and	1
benevolent	1
dispositions	1
i	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
admiration	1
of	1
their	1
virtues	1
they	1
would	1
compassionate	1
me	1
and	1
overlook	1
my	1
personal	1
deformity	1
could	1
they	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
door	1
one	1
however	1
monstrous	1
who	1
solicited	1
their	1
compassion	1
and	1
friendship	1
i	1
resolved	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
to	1
despair	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
to	1
fit	1
myself	1
for	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
decide	1
my	1
fate	1
i	1
postponed	1
this	1
attempt	1
for	1
some	1
months	1
longer	1
for	1
the	1
importance	1
attached	1
to	1
its	1
success	1
inspired	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
dread	1
lest	1
i	1
should	1
fail	1
besides	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
my	1
understanding	1
improved	1
so	1
much	1
with	1
every	1
day	1
s	1
experience	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
commence	1
this	1
undertaking	1
until	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
months	1
should	1
have	1
added	1
to	1
my	1
sagacity	1
several	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
safie	1
diffused	1
happiness	1
among	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
i	1
also	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
plenty	1
reigned	1
there	1
felix	1
and	1
agatha	1
spent	1
more	1
time	1
in	1
amusement	1
and	1
conversation	1
and	1
were	1
assisted	1
in	1
their	1
labours	1
by	1
servants	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
rich	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
their	1
feelings	1
were	1
serene	1
and	1
peaceful	1
while	1
mine	1
became	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
tumultuous	1
increase	1
of	1
knowledge	1
only	1
discovered	1
to	1
me	1
more	1
clearly	1
what	1
a	1
wretched	1
outcast	1
i	1
was	1
i	1
cherished	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
it	1
vanished	1
when	1
i	1
beheld	1
my	1
person	1
reflected	1
in	1
water	1
or	1
my	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
moonshine	1
even	1
as	1
that	1
frail	1
image	1
and	1
that	1
inconstant	1
shade	1
i	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
crush	1
these	1
fears	1
and	1
to	1
fortify	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
undergo	1
and	1
sometimes	1
i	1
allowed	1
my	1
thoughts	1
unchecked	1
by	1
reason	1
to	1
ramble	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
paradise	1
and	1
dared	1
to	1
fancy	1
amiable	1
and	1
lovely	1
creatures	1
sympathizing	1
with	1
my	1
feelings	1
and	1
cheering	1
my	1
gloom	1
their	1
angelic	1
countenances	1
breathed	1
smiles	1
of	1
consolation	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
dream	1
no	1
eve	1
soothed	1
my	1
sorrows	1
nor	1
shared	1
my	1
thoughts	1
i	1
was	1
alone	1
i	1
remembered	1
adam	1
s	1
supplication	1
to	1
his	1
creator	1
but	1
where	1
was	1
mine	1
he	1
had	1
abandoned	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
cursed	1
him	1
autumn	1
passed	1
thus	1
i	1
saw	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
grief	1
the	1
leaves	1
decay	1
and	1
fall	1
and	1
nature	1
again	1
assume	1
the	1
barren	1
and	1
bleak	1
appearance	1
it	1
had	1
worn	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
beheld	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
moon	1
yet	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
heed	1
the	1
bleakness	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
i	1
was	1
better	1
fitted	1
by	1
my	1
conformation	1
for	1
the	1
endurance	1
of	1
cold	1
than	1
heat	1
but	1
my	1
chief	1
delights	1
were	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
flowers	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
gay	1
apparel	1
of	1
summer	1
when	1
those	1
deserted	1
me	1
i	1
turned	1
with	1
more	1
attention	1
towards	1
the	1
cottagers	1
their	1
happiness	1
was	1
not	1
decreased	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
summer	1
they	1
loved	1
and	1
sympathized	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
their	1
joys	1
depending	1
on	1
each	1
other	1
were	1
not	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
casualties	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
around	1
them	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
saw	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
greater	1
became	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
claim	1
their	1
protection	1
and	1
kindness	1
my	1
heart	1
yearned	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
loved	1
by	1
these	1
amiable	1
creatures	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
sweet	1
looks	1
directed	1
towards	1
me	1
with	1
affection	1
was	1
the	1
utmost	1
limit	1
of	1
my	1
ambition	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
disdain	1
and	1
horror	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
stopped	1
at	1
their	1
door	1
were	1
never	1
driven	1
away	1
i	1
asked	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
for	1
greater	1
treasures	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
food	1
or	1
rest	1
i	1
required	1
kindness	1
and	1
sympathy	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
myself	1
utterly	1
unworthy	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
winter	1
advanced	1
and	1
an	1
entire	1
revolution	1
of	1
the	1
seasons	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
since	1
i	1
awoke	1
into	1
life	1
my	1
attention	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
was	1
solely	1
directed	1
towards	1
my	1
plan	1
of	1
introducing	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
my	1
protectors	1
i	1
revolved	1
many	1
projects	1
but	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
finally	1
fixed	1
was	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
dwelling	1
when	1
the	1
blind	1
old	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
alone	1
i	1
had	1
sagacity	1
enough	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
unnatural	1
hideousness	1
of	1
my	1
person	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
horror	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
beheld	1
me	1
my	1
voice	1
although	1
harsh	1
had	1
nothing	1
terrible	1
in	1
it	1
i	1
thought	1
therefore	1
that	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
i	1
could	1
gain	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
and	1
mediation	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
de	1
lacey	1
i	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
means	1
be	1
tolerated	1
by	1
my	1
younger	1
protectors	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
on	1
the	1
red	1
leaves	1
that	1
strewed	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
diffused	1
cheerfulness	1
although	1
it	1
denied	1
warmth	1
safie	1
agatha	1
and	1
felix	1
departed	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
country	1
walk	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
desire	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
cottage	1
when	1
his	1
children	1
had	1
departed	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
guitar	1
and	1
played	1
several	1
mournful	1
but	1
sweet	1
airs	1
more	1
sweet	1
and	1
mournful	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
him	1
play	1
before	1
at	1
first	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
illuminated	1
with	1
pleasure	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
thoughtfulness	1
and	1
sadness	1
succeeded	1
at	1
length	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
instrument	1
he	1
sat	1
absorbed	1
in	1
reflection	1
my	1
heart	1
beat	1
quick	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
hour	1
and	1
moment	1
of	1
trial	1
which	1
would	1
decide	1
my	1
hopes	1
or	1
realize	1
my	1
fears	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
fair	1
all	1
was	1
silent	1
in	1
and	1
around	1
the	1
cottage	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
opportunity	1
yet	1
when	1
i	1
proceeded	1
to	1
execute	1
my	1
plan	1
my	1
limbs	1
failed	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
again	1
i	1
rose	1
and	1
exerting	1
all	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
master	1
removed	1
the	1
planks	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
placed	1
before	1
my	1
hovel	1
to	1
conceal	1
my	1
retreat	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
revived	1
me	1
and	1
with	1
renewed	1
determination	1
i	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
their	1
cottage	1
i	1
knocked	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
come	1
in	1
i	1
entered	1
pardon	1
this	1
intrusion	1
said	1
i	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
rest	1
you	1
would	1
greatly	1
oblige	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
enter	1
said	1
de	1
lacey	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
try	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
i	1
can	1
to	1
relieve	1
your	1
wants	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
blind	1
i	1
am	1
afraid	1
i	1
shall	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
procure	1
food	1
for	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
my	1
kind	1
host	1
i	1
have	1
food	1
it	1
is	1
warmth	1
and	1
rest	1
only	1
that	1
i	1
need	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
a	1
silence	1
ensued	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
every	1
minute	1
was	1
precious	1
to	1
me	1
yet	1
i	1
remained	1
irresolute	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
interview	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
addressed	1
me	1
by	1
your	1
language	1
stranger	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
countryman	1
are	1
you	1
french	1
no	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
educated	1
by	1
a	1
french	1
family	1
and	1
understand	1
that	1
language	1
only	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
claim	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
some	1
friends	1
whom	1
i	1
sincerely	1
love	1
and	1
of	1
whose	1
favour	1
i	1
have	1
some	1
hopes	1
are	1
they	1
germans	1
no	1
they	1
are	1
french	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
change	1
the	1
subject	1
i	1
am	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
deserted	1
creature	1
i	1
look	1
around	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
relation	1
or	1
friend	1
upon	1
earth	1
these	1
amiable	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
go	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
me	1
and	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
fears	1
for	1
if	1
i	1
fail	1
there	1
i	1
am	1
an	1
outcast	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
forever	1
do	1
not	1
despair	1
to	1
be	1
friendless	1
is	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
unfortunate	1
but	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
men	1
when	1
unprejudiced	1
by	1
any	1
obvious	1
self	1
interest	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
brotherly	1
love	1
and	1
charity	1
rely	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
hopes	1
and	1
if	1
these	1
friends	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
amiable	1
do	1
not	1
despair	1
they	1
are	1
kind	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
creatures	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
they	1
are	1
prejudiced	1
against	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
good	1
dispositions	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
hitherto	1
harmless	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
beneficial	1
but	1
a	1
fatal	1
prejudice	1
clouds	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
feeling	1
and	1
kind	1
friend	1
they	1
behold	1
only	1
a	1
detestable	1
monster	1
that	1
is	1
indeed	1
unfortunate	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
blameless	1
cannot	1
you	1
undeceive	1
them	1
i	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
undertake	1
that	1
task	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
that	1
i	1
feel	1
so	1
many	1
overwhelming	1
terrors	1
i	1
tenderly	1
love	1
these	1
friends	1
i	1
have	1
unknown	1
to	1
them	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
daily	1
kindness	1
towards	1
them	1
but	1
they	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
injure	1
them	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
prejudice	1
which	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
overcome	1
where	1
do	1
these	1
friends	1
reside	1
near	1
this	1
spot	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
paused	1
and	1
then	1
continued	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
unreservedly	1
confide	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
your	1
tale	1
i	1
perhaps	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
in	1
undeceiving	1
them	1
i	1
am	1
blind	1
and	1
cannot	1
judge	1
of	1
your	1
countenance	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
your	1
words	1
which	1
persuades	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
sincere	1
i	1
am	1
poor	1
and	1
an	1
exile	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
afford	1
me	1
true	1
pleasure	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
serviceable	1
to	1
a	1
human	1
creature	1
excellent	1
man	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
and	1
accept	1
your	1
generous	1
offer	1
you	1
raise	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
by	1
this	1
kindness	1
and	1
i	1
trust	1
that	1
by	1
your	1
aid	1
i	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
your	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
heaven	1
forbid	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
really	1
criminal	1
for	1
that	1
can	1
only	1
drive	1
you	1
to	1
desperation	1
and	1
not	1
instigate	1
you	1
to	1
virtue	1
i	1
also	1
am	1
unfortunate	1
i	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
have	1
been	1
condemned	1
although	1
innocent	1
judge	1
therefore	1
if	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
for	1
your	1
misfortunes	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
my	1
best	1
and	1
only	1
benefactor	1
from	1
your	1
lips	1
first	1
have	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
kindness	1
directed	1
towards	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
forever	1
grateful	1
and	1
your	1
present	1
humanity	1
assures	1
me	1
of	1
success	1
with	1
those	1
friends	1
whom	1
i	1
am	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
meeting	1
may	1
i	1
know	1
the	1
names	1
and	1
residence	1
of	1
those	1
friends	1
i	1
paused	1
this	1
i	1
thought	1
was	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
decision	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
or	1
bestow	1
happiness	1
on	1
me	1
forever	1
i	1
struggled	1
vainly	1
for	1
firmness	1
sufficient	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
effort	1
destroyed	1
all	1
my	1
remaining	1
strength	1
i	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
and	1
sobbed	1
aloud	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
my	1
younger	1
protectors	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
lose	1
but	1
seizing	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
i	1
cried	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
save	1
and	1
protect	1
me	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
are	1
the	1
friends	1
whom	1
i	1
seek	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
desert	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
trial	1
great	1
god	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
cottage	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
felix	1
safie	1
and	1
agatha	1
entered	1
who	1
can	1
describe	1
their	1
horror	1
and	1
consternation	1
on	1
beholding	1
me	1
agatha	1
fainted	1
and	1
safie	1
unable	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
felix	1
darted	1
forward	1
and	1
with	1
supernatural	1
force	1
tore	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
whose	1
knees	1
i	1
clung	1
in	1
a	1
transport	1
of	1
fury	1
he	1
dashed	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
struck	1
me	1
violently	1
with	1
a	1
stick	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
torn	1
him	1
limb	1
from	1
limb	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
rends	1
the	1
antelope	1
but	1
my	1
heart	1
sank	1
within	1
me	1
as	1
with	1
bitter	1
sickness	1
and	1
i	1
refrained	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
repeating	1
his	1
blow	1
when	1
overcome	1
by	1
pain	1
and	1
anguish	1
i	1
quitted	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
tumult	1
escaped	1
unperceived	1
to	1
my	1
hovel	1
chapter	1
16	1
cursed	1
cursed	1
creator	1
why	1
did	1
i	1
live	1
why	1
in	1
that	1
instant	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
extinguish	1
the	1
spark	1
of	1
existence	1
which	1
you	1
had	1
so	1
wantonly	1
bestowed	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
despair	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
me	1
my	1
feelings	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
rage	1
and	1
revenge	1
i	1
could	1
with	1
pleasure	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
have	1
glutted	1
myself	1
with	1
their	1
shrieks	1
and	1
misery	1
when	1
night	1
came	1
i	1
quitted	1
my	1
retreat	1
and	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
restrained	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
discovery	1
i	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
my	1
anguish	1
in	1
fearful	1
howlings	1
i	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
that	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
toils	1
destroying	1
the	1
objects	1
that	1
obstructed	1
me	1
and	1
ranging	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
with	1
a	1
stag	1
like	1
swiftness	1
oh	1
what	1
a	1
miserable	1
night	1
i	1
passed	1
the	1
cold	1
stars	1
shone	1
in	1
mockery	1
and	1
the	1
bare	1
trees	1
waved	1
their	1
branches	1
above	1
me	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
sweet	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
bird	1
burst	1
forth	1
amidst	1
the	1
universal	1
stillness	1
all	1
save	1
i	1
were	1
at	1
rest	1
or	1
in	1
enjoyment	1
i	1
like	1
the	1
arch	1
fiend	1
bore	1
a	1
hell	1
within	1
me	1
and	1
finding	1
myself	1
unsympathized	1
with	1
wished	1
to	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
trees	1
spread	1
havoc	1
and	1
destruction	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
have	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
ruin	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
luxury	1
of	1
sensation	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
i	1
became	1
fatigued	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
bodily	1
exertion	1
and	1
sank	1
on	1
the	1
damp	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
impotence	1
of	1
despair	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
among	1
the	1
myriads	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
existed	1
who	1
would	1
pity	1
or	1
assist	1
me	1
and	1
should	1
i	1
feel	1
kindness	1
towards	1
my	1
enemies	1
no	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
declared	1
everlasting	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
species	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
against	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
formed	1
me	1
and	1
sent	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
this	1
insupportable	1
misery	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
retreat	1
during	1
that	1
day	1
accordingly	1
i	1
hid	1
myself	1
in	1
some	1
thick	1
underwood	1
determining	1
to	1
devote	1
the	1
ensuing	1
hours	1
to	1
reflection	1
on	1
my	1
situation	1
the	1
pleasant	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
pure	1
air	1
of	1
day	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
considered	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
cottage	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
believing	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
hasty	1
in	1
my	1
conclusions	1
i	1
had	1
certainly	1
acted	1
imprudently	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
that	1
my	1
conversation	1
had	1
interested	1
the	1
father	1
in	1
my	1
behalf	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
having	1
exposed	1
my	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
familiarized	1
the	1
old	1
de	1
lacey	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
have	1
discovered	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
my	1
approach	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
my	1
errors	1
to	1
be	1
irretrievable	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
consideration	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
seek	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
representations	1
win	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
party	1
these	1
thoughts	1
calmed	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
i	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
profound	1
sleep	1
but	1
the	1
fever	1
of	1
my	1
blood	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
visited	1
by	1
peaceful	1
dreams	1
the	1
horrible	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
day	1
was	1
forever	1
acting	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
the	1
females	1
were	1
flying	1
and	1
the	1
enraged	1
felix	1
tearing	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
feet	1
i	1
awoke	1
exhausted	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
night	1
i	1
crept	1
forth	1
from	1
my	1
hiding	1
place	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
food	1
when	1
my	1
hunger	1
was	1
appeased	1
i	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
well	1
known	1
path	1
that	1
conducted	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
peace	1
i	1
crept	1
into	1
my	1
hovel	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
silent	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
accustomed	1
hour	1
when	1
the	1
family	1
arose	1
that	1
hour	1
passed	1
the	1
sun	1
mounted	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
but	1
the	1
cottagers	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
i	1
trembled	1
violently	1
apprehending	1
some	1
dreadful	1
misfortune	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
cottage	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
no	1
motion	1
i	1
cannot	1
describe	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
this	1
suspense	1
presently	1
two	1
countrymen	1
passed	1
by	1
but	1
pausing	1
near	1
the	1
cottage	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
using	1
violent	1
gesticulations	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1

approached	1

i	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
quitted	1
the	1
cottage	1

morning	1

anxiously	1
to	1
discover	1
from	1
his	1
discourse	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
these	1
unusual	1
appearances	1
do	1
you	1
consider	1

his	1

him	1
that	1
you	1

pay	1
three	1
months	1

to	1

i	1
do	1
not	1

to	1
take	1
any	1
unfair	1
advantage	1

i	1
beg	1
therefore	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
take	1
some	1
days	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
your	1
determination	1
it	1
is	1
utterly	1
useless	1
replied	1
felix	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
again	1
inhabit	1
your	1
cottage	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
dreadful	1
circumstance	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
related	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
will	1
never	1
recover	1
from	1
their	1
horror	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
your	1
tenement	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
fly	1
from	1
this	1
place	1
felix	1
trembled	1
violently	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
entered	1
the	1
cottage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
and	1
then	1
departed	1
i	1
never	1

any	1
of	1
the	1

of	1

more	1
i	1
continued	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
my	1
hovel	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
utter	1
and	1
stupid	1
despair	1
my	1
protectors	1
had	1
departed	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
only	1
link	1
that	1
held	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
revenge	1
and	1
hatred	1
filled	1
my	1
bosom	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
strive	1
to	1
control	1
them	1
but	1
allowing	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
stream	1
i	1
bent	1
my	1
mind	1
towards	1
injury	1
and	1
death	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mild	1
voice	1
of	1
de	1
lacey	1
the	1
gentle	1
eyes	1
of	1

and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
arabian	1
these	1
thoughts	1
vanished	1
and	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
tears	1
somewhat	1
soothed	1
me	1
but	1
again	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
spurned	1
and	1
deserted	1
me	1
anger	1
returned	1
a	1
rage	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
injure	1
anything	1
human	1
i	1
turned	1
my	1
fury	1
towards	1
inanimate	1
objects	1
as	1
night	1
advanced	1
i	1
placed	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
combustibles	1
around	1
the	1
cottage	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
destroyed	1
every	1
vestige	1
of	1
cultivation	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
i	1
waited	1
with	1
forced	1
impatience	1
until	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
commence	1
my	1
operations	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
advanced	1
a	1
fierce	1
wind	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
quickly	1
dispersed	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
had	1
loitered	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
the	1
blast	1
tore	1
along	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
avalanche	1
and	1
produced	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
insanity	1
in	1
my	1
spirits	1
that	1
burst	1
all	1
bounds	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
reflection	1
i	1
lighted	1
the	1
dry	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
fury	1
around	1
the	1
devoted	1
cottage	1
my	1
eyes	1
still	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
western	1
horizon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
moon	1
nearly	1
touched	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
orb	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
hid	1
and	1
i	1
waved	1
my	1
brand	1
it	1
sank	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
scream	1
i	1
fired	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
heath	1
and	1
bushes	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
collected	1
the	1
wind	1
fanned	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
cottage	1
was	1
quickly	1
enveloped	1
by	1
the	1
flames	1
which	1
clung	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
licked	1
it	1
with	1
their	1
forked	1
and	1
destroying	1
tongues	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
assistance	1
could	1
save	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
habitation	1
i	1
quitted	1
the	1
scene	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
before	1
me	1
whither	1
should	1
i	1
bend	1
my	1
steps	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
fly	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
hated	1
and	1
despised	1
every	1
country	1
must	1
be	1
equally	1
horrible	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
you	1
crossed	1
my	1
mind	1
i	1
learned	1
from	1
your	1
papers	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
my	1
father	1
my	1
creator	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
could	1
i	1
apply	1
with	1
more	1
fitness	1
than	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
life	1
among	1
the	1
lessons	1
that	1
felix	1
had	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
safie	1
geography	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
omitted	1
i	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
these	1
the	1
relative	1
situations	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
countries	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
you	1
had	1
mentioned	1
geneva	1
as	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
native	1
town	1
and	1
towards	1
this	1
place	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
proceed	1
but	1
how	1
was	1
i	1
to	1
direct	1
myself	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
travel	1
in	1
a	1
southwesterly	1
direction	1
to	1
reach	1
my	1
destination	1
but	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
my	1
only	1
guide	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
towns	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
nor	1
could	1
i	1
ask	1
information	1
from	1
a	1
single	1
human	1
being	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
despair	1
from	1
you	1
only	1
could	1
i	1
hope	1
for	1
succour	1
although	1
towards	1
you	1
i	1
felt	1
no	1
sentiment	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
hatred	1
unfeeling	1
heartless	1
creator	1
you	1
had	1
endowed	1
me	1
with	1
perceptions	1
and	1
passions	1
and	1
then	1
cast	1
me	1
abroad	1
an	1
object	1
for	1
the	1
scorn	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
mankind	1
but	1
on	1
you	1
only	1
had	1
i	1
any	1
claim	1
for	1
pity	1
and	1
redress	1
and	1
from	1
you	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
seek	1
that	1
justice	1
which	1
i	1
vainly	1
attempted	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
being	1
that	1
wore	1
the	1
human	1
form	1
my	1
travels	1
were	1
long	1
and	1
the	1
sufferings	1
i	1
endured	1
intense	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
autumn	1
when	1
i	1
quitted	1
the	1
district	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
resided	1
i	1
travelled	1
only	1
at	1
night	1
fearful	1
of	1
encountering	1
the	1
visage	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
nature	1
decayed	1
around	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
heatless	1
rain	1
and	1
snow	1
poured	1
around	1
me	1
mighty	1
rivers	1
were	1
frozen	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
hard	1
and	1
chill	1
and	1
bare	1
and	1
i	1
found	1
no	1
shelter	1
oh	1
earth	1
how	1
often	1
did	1
i	1
imprecate	1
curses	1
on	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
the	1
mildness	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
had	1
fled	1
and	1
all	1
within	1
me	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
gall	1
and	1
bitterness	1
the	1
nearer	1
i	1
approached	1
to	1
your	1
habitation	1
the	1
more	1
deeply	1
did	1
i	1
feel	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revenge	1
enkindled	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
snow	1
fell	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
hardened	1
but	1
i	1
rested	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
incidents	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
directed	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
possessed	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
but	1
i	1
often	1
wandered	1
wide	1
from	1
my	1
path	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
allowed	1
me	1
no	1
respite	1
no	1
incident	1
occurred	1
from	1
which	1
my	1
rage	1
and	1
misery	1
could	1
not	1
extract	1
its	1
food	1
but	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
happened	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
on	1
the	1
confines	1
of	1
switzerland	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
recovered	1
its	1
warmth	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
green	1
confirmed	1
in	1
an	1
especial	1
manner	1
the	1
bitterness	1
and	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
i	1
generally	1
rested	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
travelled	1
only	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
secured	1
by	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
man	1
one	1
morning	1
however	1
finding	1
that	1
my	1
path	1
lay	1
through	1
a	1
deep	1
wood	1
i	1
ventured	1
to	1
continue	1
my	1
journey	1
after	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
risen	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
spring	1
cheered	1
even	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
loveliness	1
of	1
its	1
sunshine	1
and	1
the	1
balminess	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
i	1
felt	1
emotions	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
pleasure	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
appeared	1
dead	1
revive	1
within	1
me	1
half	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
these	1
sensations	1
i	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
them	1
and	1
forgetting	1
my	1
solitude	1
and	1
deformity	1
dared	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
soft	1
tears	1
again	1
bedewed	1
my	1
cheeks	1
and	1
i	1
even	1
raised	1
my	1
humid	1
eyes	1
with	1
thankfulness	1
towards	1
the	1
blessed	1
sun	1
which	1
bestowed	1
such	1
joy	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
continued	1
to	1
wind	1
among	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
until	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
its	1
boundary	1
which	1
was	1
skirted	1
by	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
rapid	1
river	1
into	1
which	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
bent	1
their	1
branches	1
now	1
budding	1
with	1
the	1
fresh	1
spring	1
here	1
i	1
paused	1
not	1
exactly	1
knowing	1
what	1
path	1
to	1
pursue	1
when	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
that	1
induced	1
me	1
to	1
conceal	1
myself	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
cypress	1
i	1
was	1
scarcely	1
hid	1
when	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
came	1
running	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
i	1
was	1
concealed	1
laughing	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
ran	1
from	1
someone	1
in	1
sport	1
she	1
continued	1
her	1
course	1
along	1
the	1
precipitous	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
when	1
suddenly	1
her	1
foot	1
slipped	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
rapid	1
stream	1
i	1
rushed	1
from	1
my	1
hiding	1
place	1
and	1
with	1
extreme	1
labour	1
from	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
saved	1
her	1
and	1
dragged	1
her	1
to	1
shore	1
she	1
was	1
senseless	1
and	1
i	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
restore	1
animation	1
when	1
i	1
was	1
suddenly	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
rustic	1
who	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
person	1
from	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
playfully	1
fled	1
on	1
seeing	1
me	1
he	1
darted	1
towards	1
me	1
and	1
tearing	1
the	1
girl	1
from	1
my	1
arms	1
hastened	1
towards	1
the	1
deeper	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
i	1
followed	1
speedily	1
i	1
hardly	1
knew	1
why	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
saw	1
me	1
draw	1
near	1
he	1
aimed	1
a	1
gun	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
at	1
my	1
body	1
and	1
fired	1
i	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
my	1
injurer	1
with	1
increased	1
swiftness	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
this	1
was	1
then	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
benevolence	1
i	1
had	1
saved	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
from	1
destruction	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
recompense	1
i	1
now	1
writhed	1
under	1
the	1
miserable	1
pain	1
of	1
a	1
wound	1
which	1
shattered	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
bone	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
entertained	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
before	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
hellish	1
rage	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth	1
inflamed	1
by	1
pain	1
i	1
vowed	1
eternal	1
hatred	1
and	1
vengeance	1
to	1
all	1
mankind	1
but	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
my	1
wound	1
overcame	1
me	1
my	1
pulses	1
paused	1
and	1
i	1
fainted	1
for	1
some	1
weeks	1
i	1
led	1
a	1
miserable	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
cure	1
the	1
wound	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
entered	1
my	1
shoulder	1
and	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
remained	1
there	1
or	1
passed	1
through	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
extracting	1
it	1
my	1
sufferings	1
were	1
augmented	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
oppressive	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
and	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
their	1
infliction	1
my	1
daily	1
vows	1
rose	1
for	1
revenge	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
deadly	1
revenge	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
alone	1
compensate	1
for	1
the	1
outrages	1
and	1
anguish	1
i	1
had	1
endured	1
after	1
some	1
weeks	1
my	1
wound	1
healed	1
and	1
i	1
continued	1
my	1
journey	1
the	1
labours	1
i	1
endured	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
alleviated	1
by	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
or	1
gentle	1
breezes	1
of	1
spring	1
all	1
joy	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
mockery	1
which	1
insulted	1
my	1
desolate	1
state	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
feel	1
more	1
painfully	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
pleasure	1
but	1
my	1
toils	1
now	1
drew	1
near	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
i	1
reached	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
geneva	1
it	1
was	1
evening	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
and	1
i	1
retired	1
to	1
a	1
hiding	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
fields	1
that	1
surround	1
it	1
to	1
meditate	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
i	1
should	1
apply	1
to	1
you	1
i	1
was	1
oppressed	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
hunger	1
and	1
far	1
too	1
unhappy	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
gentle	1
breezes	1
of	1
evening	1
or	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
setting	1
behind	1
the	1
stupendous	1
mountains	1
of	1
jura	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
a	1
slight	1
sleep	1
relieved	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
reflection	1
which	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
child	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
recess	1
i	1
had	1
chosen	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sportiveness	1
of	1
infancy	1
suddenly	1
as	1
i	1
gazed	1
on	1
him	1
an	1
idea	1
seized	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
creature	1
was	1
unprejudiced	1
and	1
had	1
lived	1
too	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
imbibed	1
a	1
horror	1
of	1
deformity	1
if	1
therefore	1
i	1
could	1
seize	1
him	1
and	1
educate	1
him	1
as	1
my	1
companion	1
and	1
friend	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
desolate	1
in	1
this	1
peopled	1
earth	1
urged	1
by	1
this	1
impulse	1
i	1
seized	1
on	1
the	1
boy	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
towards	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
beheld	1
my	1
form	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
shrill	1
scream	1
i	1
drew	1
his	1
hand	1
forcibly	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
said	1
child	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
hurt	1
you	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
struggled	1
violently	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
he	1
cried	1
monster	1
ugly	1
wretch	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
eat	1
me	1
and	1
tear	1
me	1
to	1
pieces	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
ogre	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
or	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
my	1
papa	1
boy	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
your	1
father	1
again	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
hideous	1
monster	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
my	1
papa	1
is	1
a	1
syndic	1
he	1
is	1
m	1
frankenstein	1
he	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
you	1
dare	1
not	1
keep	1
me	1

you	1
belong	1
then	1
to	1
my	1
enemy	1
to	1
him	1
towards	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
sworn	1
eternal	1
revenge	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
first	1
victim	1
the	1
child	1
still	1
struggled	1
and	1
loaded	1
me	1
with	1
epithets	1
which	1
carried	1
despair	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
grasped	1
his	1
throat	1
to	1
silence	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
lay	1
dead	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
i	1
gazed	1
on	1
my	1
victim	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
swelled	1
with	1
exultation	1
and	1
hellish	1
triumph	1
clapping	1
my	1
hands	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
i	1
too	1
can	1
create	1
desolation	1
my	1
enemy	1
is	1
not	1
invulnerable	1
this	1
death	1
will	1
carry	1
despair	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
miseries	1
shall	1
torment	1
and	1
destroy	1
him	1
as	1
i	1
fixed	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
child	1
i	1
saw	1
something	1
glittering	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
i	1
took	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
lovely	1
woman	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
malignity	1
it	1
softened	1
and	1
attracted	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
i	1
gazed	1
with	1
delight	1
on	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
fringed	1
by	1
deep	1
lashes	1
and	1
her	1
lovely	1
lips	1
but	1
presently	1
my	1
rage	1
returned	1
i	1
remembered	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
forever	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
delights	1
that	1
such	1
beautiful	1
creatures	1
could	1
bestow	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
whose	1
resemblance	1
i	1
contemplated	1
would	1
in	1
regarding	1
me	1
have	1
changed	1
that	1
air	1
of	1
divine	1
benignity	1
to	1
one	1
expressive	1
of	1
disgust	1
and	1
affright	1
can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
such	1
thoughts	1
transported	1
me	1
with	1
rage	1
i	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
instead	1
of	1
venting	1
my	1
sensations	1
in	1
exclamations	1
and	1
agony	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
rush	1
among	1
mankind	1
and	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
these	1
feelings	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
committed	1
the	1
murder	1
and	1
seeking	1
a	1
more	1
secluded	1
hiding	1
place	1
i	1
entered	1
a	1
barn	1
which	1
had	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
empty	1
a	1
woman	1
was	1
sleeping	1
on	1
some	1
straw	1
she	1
was	1
young	1
not	1
indeed	1
so	1
beautiful	1
as	1
her	1
whose	1
portrait	1
i	1
held	1
but	1
of	1
an	1
agreeable	1
aspect	1
and	1
blooming	1
in	1
the	1
loveliness	1
of	1
youth	1
and	1
health	1
here	1
i	1
thought	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
joy	1
imparting	1
smiles	1
are	1
bestowed	1
on	1
all	1
but	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
whispered	1
awake	1
fairest	1
thy	1
lover	1
is	1
near	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
one	1
look	1
of	1
affection	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes	1
my	1
beloved	1
awake	1
the	1
sleeper	1
stirred	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
terror	1
ran	1
through	1
me	1
should	1
she	1
indeed	1
awake	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
curse	1
me	1
and	1
denounce	1
the	1
murderer	1
thus	1
would	1
she	1
assuredly	1
act	1
if	1
her	1
darkened	1
eyes	1
opened	1
and	1
she	1
beheld	1
me	1
the	1
thought	1
was	1
madness	1
it	1
stirred	1
the	1
fiend	1
within	1
me	1
not	1
i	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
suffer	1
the	1
murder	1
i	1
have	1
committed	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
forever	1
robbed	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
me	1
she	1
shall	1
atone	1
the	1
crime	1
had	1
its	1
source	1
in	1
her	1
be	1
hers	1
the	1
punishment	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
felix	1
and	1
the	1
sanguinary	1
laws	1
of	1
man	1
i	1
had	1
learned	1
now	1
to	1
work	1
mischief	1
i	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
placed	1
the	1
portrait	1
securely	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
she	1
moved	1
again	1
and	1
i	1
fled	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
i	1
haunted	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
these	1
scenes	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
sometimes	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
sometimes	1
resolved	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
its	1
miseries	1
forever	1
at	1
length	1
i	1
wandered	1
towards	1
these	1
mountains	1
and	1
have	1
ranged	1
through	1
their	1
immense	1
recesses	1
consumed	1
by	1
a	1
burning	1
passion	1
which	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
gratify	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
part	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
my	1
requisition	1
i	1
am	1
alone	1
and	1
miserable	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
associate	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
one	1
as	1
deformed	1
and	1
horrible	1
as	1
myself	1
would	1
not	1
deny	1
herself	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
companion	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1

species	1
and	1
have	1
the	1

defects	1
this	1
being	1
you	1
must	1
create	1
chapter	1
17	1
the	1
being	1
finished	1
speaking	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
looks	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
reply	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
bewildered	1
perplexed	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
arrange	1
my	1
ideas	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
full	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
proposition	1
he	1
continued	1
you	1
must	1
create	1
a	1
female	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
whom	1
i	1
can	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
those	1
sympathies	1
necessary	1
for	1
my	1
being	1
this	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
do	1
and	1
i	1
demand	1
it	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
right	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
concede	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
tale	1
had	1
kindled	1
anew	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
anger	1
that	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
while	1
he	1
narrated	1
his	1
peaceful	1
life	1
among	1
the	1
cottagers	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
i	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
suppress	1
the	1
rage	1
that	1
burned	1
within	1
me	1
i	1
do	1
refuse	1
it	1
i	1
replied	1
and	1
no	1
torture	1
shall	1
ever	1
extort	1
a	1
consent	1
from	1
me	1
you	1
may	1
render	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
men	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
make	1
me	1
base	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
shall	1
i	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
yourself	1
whose	1
joint	1
wickedness	1
might	1
desolate	1
the	1
world	1
begone	1
i	1
have	1
answered	1
you	1
you	1
may	1
torture	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
never	1
consent	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
replied	1
the	1
fiend	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
threatening	1
i	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
am	1
malicious	1
because	1
i	1
am	1
miserable	1
am	1
i	1
not	1
shunned	1
and	1
hated	1
by	1
all	1
mankind	1
you	1
my	1
creator	1
would	1
tear	1
me	1
to	1
pieces	1
and	1
triumph	1
remember	1
that	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
why	1
i	1
should	1
pity	1
man	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
pities	1
me	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
call	1
it	1
murder	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
precipitate	1
me	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
ice	1
rifts	1
and	1
destroy	1
my	1
frame	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
your	1

hands	1
shall	1
i	1
respect	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
condemns	1
me	1
let	1
him	1
live	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
injury	1
i	1
would	1
bestow	1
every	1
benefit	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
gratitude	1
at	1
his	1
acceptance	1
but	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
human	1
senses	1
are	1
insurmountable	1
barriers	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
yet	1
mine	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
abject	1
slavery	1
i	1
will	1
revenge	1
my	1
injuries	1
if	1
i	1
cannot	1
inspire	1
love	1
i	1
will	1
cause	1
fear	1
and	1
chiefly	1
towards	1
you	1
my	1
arch	1
enemy	1
because	1
my	1
creator	1
do	1
i	1
swear	1
inextinguishable	1
hatred	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
i	1
will	1
work	1
at	1
your	1
destruction	1
nor	1
finish	1
until	1
i	1
desolate	1
your	1
heart	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
curse	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
your	1
birth	1
a	1
fiendish	1
rage	1
animated	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
wrinkled	1
into	1
contortions	1
too	1
horrible	1
for	1
human	1
eyes	1
to	1
behold	1
but	1
presently	1
he	1
calmed	1
himself	1
and	1
proceeded	1
i	1
intended	1
to	1
reason	1
this	1
passion	1
is	1
detrimental	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
reflect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
its	1
excess	1
if	1
any	1
being	1
felt	1
emotions	1
of	1
benevolence	1
towards	1
me	1
i	1
should	1
return	1
them	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
a	1
hundredfold	1
for	1
that	1
one	1
creature	1
s	1
sake	1
i	1
would	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
kind	1
but	1
i	1
now	1
indulge	1
in	1
dreams	1
of	1
bliss	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
realized	1
what	1
i	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
reasonable	1
and	1
moderate	1
i	1
demand	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
another	1
sex	1
but	1
as	1
hideous	1
as	1
myself	1
the	1
gratification	1
is	1
small	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
receive	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
content	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
monsters	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
attached	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
our	1
lives	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
happy	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
harmless	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
misery	1
i	1
now	1
feel	1
oh	1
my	1
creator	1
make	1
me	1
happy	1
let	1
me	1
feel	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
you	1
for	1
one	1
benefit	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
that	1
i	1
excite	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
some	1
existing	1
thing	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
me	1
my	1
request	1
i	1
was	1
moved	1
i	1
shuddered	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
possible	1
consequences	1
of	1
my	1
consent	1
but	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
justice	1
in	1
his	1
argument	1
his	1
tale	1
and	1
the	1
feelings	1
he	1
now	1
expressed	1
proved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
fine	1
sensations	1
and	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
as	1
his	1
maker	1
owe	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
bestow	1
he	1
saw	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
continued	1
if	1
you	1
consent	1
neither	1
you	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
human	1
being	1
shall	1
ever	1
see	1
us	1
again	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
vast	1
wilds	1
of	1
south	1
america	1
my	1
food	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
man	1
i	1
do	1
not	1

i	1

a	1
moment	1

you	1

you	1
again	1

yourself	1

my	1

to	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
earth	1

by	1
you	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
that	1
with	1

i	1
will	1

it	1

in	1
the	1

my	1
evil	1

i	1

my	1

my	1
maker	1
his	1
words	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
effect	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
compassionated	1
him	1
and	1
sometimes	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
console	1
him	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
looked	1
upon	1
him	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
filthy	1
mass	1
that	1
moved	1

talked	1
my	1
heart	1
sickened	1

my	1
feelings	1
were	1
altered	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
hatred	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
stifle	1
these	1
sensations	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
him	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
withhold	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
small	1
portion	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
bestow	1
you	1
swear	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
harmless	1
but	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
already	1
shown	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
malice	1
that	1
should	1
reasonably	1
make	1
me	1
distrust	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
even	1
this	1
be	1
a	1
feint	1
that	1
will	1
increase	1
your	1
triumph	1
by	1
affording	1
a	1
wider	1
scope	1
for	1
your	1
revenge	1
how	1
is	1
this	1
i	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
trifled	1
with	1
and	1
i	1
demand	1
an	1
answer	1
if	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
ties	1
and	1
no	1
affections	1
hatred	1
and	1
vice	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
portion	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
another	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
crimes	1
and	1
i	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
whose	1
existence	1
everyone	1
will	1
be	1
ignorant	1
my	1
vices	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
forced	1
solitude	1
that	1
i	1
abhor	1
and	1
my	1
virtues	1
will	1
necessarily	1
arise	1
when	1
i	1
live	1
in	1
communion	1
with	1
an	1
equal	1
i	1
shall	1
feel	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
being	1
and	1
become	1
linked	1
to	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
existence	1
and	1
events	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
excluded	1
i	1
paused	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
related	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
arguments	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
employed	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
virtues	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
displayed	1
on	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
and	1
the	1
subsequent	1
blight	1
of	1
all	1
kindly	1
feeling	1
by	1
the	1
loathing	1
and	1
scorn	1
which	1
his	1
protectors	1
had	1
manifested	1
towards	1
him	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
threats	1
were	1
not	1
omitted	1
in	1
my	1
calculations	1
a	1
creature	1
who	1
could	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
ice	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
glaciers	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
pursuit	1
among	1
the	1
ridges	1
of	1
inaccessible	1
precipices	1
was	1
a	1
being	1
possessing	1
faculties	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
vain	1
to	1
cope	1
with	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause	1
of	1
reflection	1
i	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
due	1
both	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
demanded	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
request	1
turning	1
to	1
him	1
therefore	1
i	1
said	1
i	1
consent	1
to	1
your	1
demand	1
on	1
your	1
solemn	1
oath	1
to	1
quit	1
europe	1
forever	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
i	1
shall	1
deliver	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
a	1
female	1
who	1
will	1
accompany	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
exile	1
i	1
swear	1
he	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
blue	1
sky	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
love	1
that	1
burns	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
grant	1
my	1
prayer	1
while	1
they	1
exist	1
you	1
shall	1
never	1
behold	1
me	1
again	1
depart	1
to	1
your	1
home	1
and	1
commence	1
your	1
labours	1
i	1
shall	1
watch	1
their	1
progress	1
with	1
unutterable	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
ready	1
i	1
shall	1
appear	1
saying	1
this	1
he	1
suddenly	1
quitted	1
me	1
fearful	1
perhaps	1
of	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
sentiments	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
descend	1
the	1
mountain	1
with	1
greater	1
speed	1
than	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
an	1
eagle	1
and	1
quickly	1
lost	1
among	1
the	1
undulations	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
his	1
tale	1
had	1
occupied	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
the	1
horizon	1
when	1
he	1
departed	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
ought	1
to	1
hasten	1
my	1
descent	1
towards	1
the	1
valley	1
as	1
i	1
should	1
soon	1
be	1
encompassed	1
in	1
darkness	1
but	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
heavy	1
and	1
my	1
steps	1
slow	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
winding	1
among	1
the	1
little	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
and	1
fixing	1
my	1
feet	1
firmly	1
as	1
i	1
advanced	1
perplexed	1
me	1
occupied	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
emotions	1
which	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
had	1
produced	1
night	1
was	1
far	1
advanced	1
when	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
halfway	1
resting	1
place	1
and	1
seated	1
myself	1
beside	1
the	1
fountain	1
the	1
stars	1
shone	1
at	1
intervals	1
as	1
the	1
clouds	1
passed	1
from	1
over	1
them	1
the	1
dark	1
pines	1
rose	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
every	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
broken	1
tree	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
scene	1
of	1
wonderful	1
solemnity	1
and	1
stirred	1
strange	1
thoughts	1
within	1
me	1
i	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
and	1
clasping	1
my	1
hands	1
in	1
agony	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
oh	1
stars	1
and	1
clouds	1
and	1
winds	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
about	1
to	1
mock	1
me	1
if	1
ye	1
really	1
pity	1
me	1
crush	1
sensation	1
and	1
memory	1
let	1
me	1
become	1
as	1
nought	1
but	1
if	1
not	1
depart	1
depart	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
darkness	1
these	1
were	1
wild	1
and	1
miserable	1
thoughts	1
but	1
i	1
cannot	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
the	1
eternal	1
twinkling	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
weighed	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
how	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
every	1
blast	1
of	1
wind	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
dull	1
ugly	1
siroc	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
consume	1
me	1
morning	1
dawned	1
before	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
chamounix	1
i	1
took	1
no	1
rest	1
but	1
returned	1
immediately	1
to	1
geneva	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
i	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
expression	1
to	1
my	1
sensations	1
they	1
weighed	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
mountain	1
s	1
weight	1
and	1
their	1
excess	1
destroyed	1
my	1
agony	1
beneath	1
them	1
thus	1
i	1
returned	1
home	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
presented	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
my	1
haggard	1
and	1
wild	1
appearance	1
awoke	1
intense	1
alarm	1
but	1
i	1
answered	1
no	1
question	1
scarcely	1
did	1
i	1
speak	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
placed	1
under	1
a	1
ban	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
claim	1
their	1
sympathies	1
as	1
if	1
never	1
more	1
might	1
i	1
enjoy	1
companionship	1
with	1
them	1
yet	1
even	1
thus	1
i	1
loved	1
them	1
to	1
adoration	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
dedicate	1
myself	1
to	1
my	1
most	1
abhorred	1
task	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
occupation	1
made	1
every	1
other	1
circumstance	1
of	1
existence	1
pass	1
before	1
me	1
like	1
a	1

of	1

day	1

after	1

passed	1
away	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
geneva	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
collect	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
recommence	1
my	1
work	1
i	1
feared	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
disappointed	1
fiend	1
yet	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
overcome	1
my	1
repugnance	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
which	1
was	1
enjoined	1
me	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
compose	1
a	1
female	1
without	1
again	1
devoting	1
several	1
months	1
to	1
profound	1
study	1
and	1
laborious	1
disquisition	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
some	1
discoveries	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
an	1
english	1
philosopher	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
material	1
to	1
my	1
success	1
and	1
i	1
sometimes	1
thought	1
of	1
obtaining	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
consent	1
to	1
visit	1
england	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
but	1
i	1
clung	1
to	1
every	1
pretence	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
shrank	1
from	1
taking	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
in	1
an	1
undertaking	1
whose	1
immediate	1
necessity	1
began	1
to	1
appear	1
less	1
absolute	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
change	1

had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
me	1
my	1
health	1
which	1
had	1
hitherto	1
declined	1
was	1
now	1
much	1
restored	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
when	1
unchecked	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
my	1
unhappy	1
promise	1
rose	1
proportionably	1
my	1
father	1
saw	1
this	1
change	1
with	1
pleasure	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
thoughts	1
towards	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
of	1
eradicating	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
melancholy	1
which	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
would	1
return	1
by	1
fits	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
devouring	1
blackness	1
overcast	1
the	1
approaching	1
sunshine	1
at	1
these	1
moments	1
i	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
solitude	1
i	1
passed	1
whole	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
lake	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
watching	1
the	1
clouds	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
rippling	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
silent	1
and	1
listless	1
but	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
and	1
bright	1
sun	1
seldom	1
failed	1
to	1
restore	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
i	1
met	1
the	1
salutations	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
with	1
a	1
readier	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
heart	1
it	1
was	1
after	1
my	1
return	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
rambles	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
calling	1
me	1
aside	1
thus	1
addressed	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
remark	1
my	1
dear	1
son	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
resumed	1
your	1
former	1
pleasures	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
returning	1
to	1
yourself	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
unhappy	1
and	1
still	1
avoid	1
our	1
society	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
i	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
conjecture	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
yesterday	1
an	1
idea	1
struck	1
me	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
founded	1
i	1
conjure	1
you	1
to	1
avow	1
it	1
reserve	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
would	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
useless	1
but	1
draw	1
down	1
treble	1
misery	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
i	1
trembled	1
violently	1
at	1
his	1
exordium	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
continued	1
i	1
confess	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
always	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
your	1
marriage	1
with	1
our	1
dear	1
elizabeth	1

the	1

of	1
our	1
domestic	1
comfort	1
and	1
the	1
stay	1
of	1
my	1
declining	1
years	1
you	1
were	1
attached	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
your	1
earliest	1
infancy	1
you	1
studied	1
together	1
and	1
appeared	1
in	1
dispositions	1
and	1
tastes	1
entirely	1
suited	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
but	1
so	1
blind	1
is	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
what	1
i	1
conceived	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
assistants	1
to	1
my	1
plan	1
may	1
have	1
entirely	1
destroyed	1
it	1
you	1
perhaps	1
regard	1
her	1
as	1
your	1
sister	1
without	1
any	1
wish	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
become	1
your	1
wife	1
nay	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
another	1
whom	1
you	1
may	1
love	1
and	1
considering	1
yourself	1
as	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
this	1
struggle	1
may	1
occasion	1
the	1
poignant	1
misery	1
which	1
you	1
appear	1
to	1
feel	1

dear	1
father	1
reassure	1
yourself	1
i	1
love	1
my	1
cousin	1
tenderly	1
and	1
sincerely	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
any	1
woman	1
who	1
excited	1
as	1
elizabeth	1
does	1
my	1
warmest	1
admiration	1
and	1
affection	1
my	1
future	1
hopes	1
and	1
prospects	1
are	1
entirely	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
our	1
union	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
your	1
sentiments	1
of	1
this	1
subject	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
gives	1
me	1
more	1
pleasure	1
than	1
i	1
have	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
experienced	1
if	1
you	1
feel	1
thus	1
we	1
shall	1
assuredly	1
be	1
happy	1
however	1
present	1
events	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
gloom	1
over	1
us	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
gloom	1
which	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
so	1
strong	1
a	1
hold	1
of	1
your	1
mind	1
that	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
dissipate	1
tell	1
me	1
therefore	1
whether	1
you	1
object	1
to	1
an	1
immediate	1
solemnization	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
recent	1
events	1
have	1
drawn	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
everyday	1
tranquillity	1
befitting	1
my	1
years	1
and	1
infirmities	1
you	1
are	1
younger	1
yet	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
possessed	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
competent	1
fortune	1
that	1
an	1
early	1
marriage	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
interfere	1
with	1
any	1
future	1
plans	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
utility	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
formed	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
however	1
that	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
dictate	1
happiness	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
that	1
a	1
delay	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
would	1
cause	1
me	1
any	1
serious	1
uneasiness	1
interpret	1
my	1
words	1
with	1
candour	1
and	1
answer	1
me	1
i	1
conjure	1
you	1
with	1
confidence	1
and	1
sincerity	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
incapable	1
of	1
offering	1
any	1
reply	1
i	1
revolved	1
rapidly	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
thoughts	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
some	1
conclusion	1
alas	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
immediate	1
union	1
with	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
dismay	1
i	1
was	1
bound	1
by	1
a	1
solemn	1
promise	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
fulfilled	1
and	1
dared	1
not	1
break	1
or	1
if	1
i	1
did	1
what	1
manifold	1
miseries	1
might	1
not	1
impend	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
devoted	1
family	1
could	1
i	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
festival	1
with	1
this	1
deadly	1
weight	1
yet	1
hanging	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
bowing	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
i	1
must	1
perform	1
my	1
engagement	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
monster	1
depart	1
with	1
his	1
mate	1
before	1
i	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
a	1
union	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
expected	1
peace	1
i	1
remembered	1
also	1
the	1
necessity	1
imposed	1
upon	1
me	1
of	1
either	1
journeying	1
to	1
england	1
or	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
long	1
correspondence	1
with	1
those	1
philosophers	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
whose	1
knowledge	1
and	1
discoveries	1
were	1
of	1
indispensable	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
present	1
undertaking	1
the	1
latter	1
method	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
desired	1
intelligence	1
was	1
dilatory	1
and	1
unsatisfactory	1
besides	1
i	1
had	1
an	1
insurmountable	1
aversion	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
engaging	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
loathsome	1
task	1
in	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
house	1
while	1
in	1
habits	1
of	1
familiar	1
intercourse	1
with	1
those	1
i	1
loved	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
a	1
thousand	1
fearful	1
accidents	1
might	1
occur	1
the	1
slightest	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
disclose	1
a	1
tale	1
to	1
thrill	1
all	1
connected	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
horror	1
i	1
was	1
aware	1
also	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
often	1
lose	1
all	1
self	1
command	1
all	1
capacity	1
of	1
hiding	1
the	1
harrowing	1
sensations	1
that	1
would	1
possess	1
me	1
during	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
my	1
unearthly	1
occupation	1
i	1
must	1
absent	1
myself	1
from	1
all	1
i	1
loved	1
while	1
thus	1
employed	1
once	1
commenced	1
it	1
would	1
quickly	1
be	1
achieved	1
and	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
my	1
family	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness	1
my	1
promise	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
monster	1
would	1
depart	1
forever	1
or	1
so	1
my	1
fond	1
fancy	1
imaged	1
some	1
accident	1
might	1
meanwhile	1
occur	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
slavery	1
forever	1
these	1
feelings	1
dictated	1
my	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
i	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
visit	1
england	1
but	1
concealing	1
the	1
true	1
reasons	1
of	1
this	1
request	1
i	1
clothed	1
my	1
desires	1
under	1
a	1
guise	1
which	1
excited	1
no	1
suspicion	1
while	1
i	1
urged	1
my	1
desire	1
with	1
an	1
earnestness	1
that	1
easily	1
induced	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
comply	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
an	1
absorbing	1
melancholy	1
that	1
resembled	1
madness	1
in	1
its	1
intensity	1
and	1
effects	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
taking	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
journey	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
change	1
of	1
scene	1
and	1
varied	1
amusement	1
would	1
before	1
my	1
return	1
have	1
restored	1
me	1
entirely	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
my	1
absence	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
choice	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
or	1
at	1
most	1
a	1
year	1
was	1
the	1
period	1
contemplated	1
one	1
paternal	1
kind	1
precaution	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
ensure	1
my	1
having	1
a	1
companion	1
without	1
previously	1
communicating	1
with	1
me	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
concert	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
arranged	1
that	1
clerval	1
should	1
join	1
me	1
at	1
strasbourg	1
this	1
interfered	1
with	1
the	1
solitude	1
i	1
coveted	1
for	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
could	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
be	1
an	1
impediment	1
and	1
truly	1
i	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
thus	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
lonely	1
maddening	1
reflection	1
nay	1
henry	1
might	1
stand	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
intrusion	1
of	1
my	1
foe	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
alone	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
at	1
times	1
force	1
his	1
abhorred	1
presence	1
on	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
task	1
or	1
to	1
contemplate	1
its	1
progress	1
to	1
england	1
therefore	1
i	1
was	1
bound	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
that	1
my	1
union	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
immediately	1
on	1
my	1
return	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
age	1
rendered	1
him	1
extremely	1
averse	1
to	1
delay	1
for	1
myself	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
reward	1
i	1
promised	1
myself	1
from	1
my	1
detested	1
toils	1
one	1
consolation	1
for	1
my	1
unparalleled	1
sufferings	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
enfranchised	1
from	1
my	1
miserable	1
slavery	1
i	1
might	1
claim	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
forget	1
the	1
past	1
in	1
my	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
now	1
made	1
arrangements	1
for	1
my	1
journey	1
but	1
one	1
feeling	1
haunted	1
me	1
which	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
agitation	1
during	1
my	1
absence	1
i	1
should	1
leave	1
my	1
friends	1
unconscious	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
their	1
enemy	1
and	1
unprotected	1
from	1
his	1
attacks	1
exasperated	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
my	1
departure	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
follow	1
me	1
wherever	1
i	1
might	1
go	1
and	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
accompany	1
me	1
to	1
england	1
this	1
imagination	1
was	1
dreadful	1
in	1
itself	1
but	1
soothing	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
supposed	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
i	1
was	1
agonized	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
this	1
might	1
happen	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
my	1
creature	1
i	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
impulses	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
my	1
present	1
sensations	1
strongly	1
intimated	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
would	1
follow	1
me	1
and	1
exempt	1
my	1
family	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
machinations	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
september	1
that	1
i	1
again	1
quitted	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
my	1
journey	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
own	1
suggestion	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
therefore	1
acquiesced	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
disquiet	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
my	1
suffering	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
inroads	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
grief	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
care	1
which	1
provided	1
me	1
a	1
companion	1
in	1
clerval	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
blind	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
minute	1
circumstances	1
which	1
call	1
forth	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
sedulous	1
attention	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
bid	1
me	1
hasten	1
my	1
return	1
a	1
thousand	1
conflicting	1
emotions	1
rendered	1
her	1
mute	1
as	1
she	1
bade	1
me	1
a	1
tearful	1
silent	1
farewell	1
i	1
threw	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
convey	1
me	1
away	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
whither	1
i	1
was	1
going	1
and	1
careless	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
around	1
i	1
remembered	1
only	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
bitter	1
anguish	1
that	1
i	1
reflected	1
on	1
it	1
to	1
order	1
that	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
should	1
be	1
packed	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
filled	1
with	1
dreary	1
imaginations	1
i	1
passed	1
through	1
many	1
beautiful	1
and	1
majestic	1
scenes	1
but	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
and	1
unobserving	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
bourne	1
of	1
my	1
travels	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
occupy	1
me	1
whilst	1
they	1
endured	1
after	1
some	1
days	1
spent	1
in	1
listless	1
indolence	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
traversed	1
many	1
leagues	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
strasbourg	1
where	1
i	1
waited	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
clerval	1
he	1
came	1
alas	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
us	1
he	1
was	1
alive	1
to	1
every	1
new	1
scene	1
joyful	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun	1
and	1
more	1
happy	1
when	1
he	1
beheld	1
it	1
rise	1
and	1
recommence	1
a	1
new	1
day	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
shifting	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
landscape	1
and	1
the	1
appearances	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
he	1
cried	1
how	1
i	1
enjoy	1
existence	1
but	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
frankenstein	1
wherefore	1
are	1
you	1
desponding	1
and	1
sorrowful	1
in	1
truth	1
i	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
and	1
neither	1
saw	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
star	1
nor	1
the	1
golden	1
sunrise	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
rhine	1
and	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
amused	1
with	1
the	1
journal	1
of	1
clerval	1
who	1
observed	1
the	1
scenery	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
delight	1
than	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
my	1
reflections	1
i	1
a	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
haunted	1
by	1
a	1
curse	1
that	1
shut	1
up	1
every	1
avenue	1
to	1
enjoyment	1
we	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
rhine	1
in	1
a	1
boat	1
from	1
strasbourg	1
to	1
rotterdam	1
whence	1
we	1
might	1
take	1
shipping	1
for	1
london	1
during	1
this	1
voyage	1
we	1
passed	1
many	1
willowy	1
islands	1
and	1
saw	1
several	1
beautiful	1
towns	1
we	1
stayed	1
a	1
day	1
at	1
mannheim	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
from	1
our	1
departure	1
from	1
strasbourg	1
arrived	1
at	1
mainz	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
rhine	1
below	1
mainz	1
becomes	1
much	1
more	1
picturesque	1
the	1
river	1
descends	1
rapidly	1
and	1
winds	1
between	1
hills	1
not	1
high	1
but	1
steep	1
and	1
of	1
beautiful	1
forms	1
we	1
saw	1
many	1
ruined	1
castles	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
precipices	1
surrounded	1
by	1
black	1
woods	1
high	1
and	1
inaccessible	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rhine	1
indeed	1
presents	1
a	1
singularly	1
variegated	1
landscape	1
in	1
one	1
spot	1
you	1
view	1
rugged	1
hills	1
ruined	1
castles	1
overlooking	1
tremendous	1
precipices	1
with	1
the	1
dark	1
rhine	1
rushing	1
beneath	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
sudden	1

a	1
promontory	1
flourishing	1
vineyards	1
with	1
green	1
sloping	1
banks	1
and	1
a	1
meandering	1
river	1
and	1
populous	1
towns	1
occupy	1
the	1
scene	1
we	1
travelled	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
vintage	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
as	1
we	1
glided	1
down	1
the	1
stream	1
even	1
i	1
depressed	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
continually	1
agitated	1
by	1
gloomy	1
feelings	1
even	1
i	1
was	1
pleased	1
i	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
gazed	1
on	1
the	1
cloudless	1
blue	1
sky	1
i	1
seemed	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
a	1
tranquillity	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
if	1
these	1
were	1
my	1
sensations	1
who	1
can	1
describe	1
those	1
of	1
henry	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
transported	1
to	1
fairy	1
land	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
happiness	1
seldom	1
tasted	1
by	1
man	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
scenes	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
country	1
i	1
have	1
visited	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
lucerne	1
and	1
uri	1
where	1
the	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
descend	1
almost	1
perpendicularly	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
casting	1
black	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
shades	1
which	1
would	1
cause	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
mournful	1
appearance	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
verdant	1
islands	1
that	1
believe	1
the	1
eye	1
by	1
their	1
gay	1
appearance	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
lake	1
agitated	1
by	1
a	1
tempest	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
tore	1
up	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
gave	1
you	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
water	1
spout	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
ocean	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
dash	1
with	1
fury	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
where	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
his	1
mistress	1
were	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
an	1
avalanche	1
and	1
where	1
their	1
dying	1
voices	1
are	1
still	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
amid	1
the	1
pauses	1
of	1
the	1
nightly	1
wind	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
la	1
valais	1
and	1
the	1
pays	1
de	1
vaud	1
but	1
this	1
country	1
victor	1
pleases	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
those	1
wonders	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
switzerland	1
are	1
more	1
majestic	1
and	1
strange	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
charm	1
in	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
this	1
divine	1
river	1
that	1
i	1
never	1
before	1
saw	1
equalled	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
castle	1
which	1
overhangs	1
yon	1
precipice	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
island	1
almost	1
concealed	1
amongst	1
the	1
foliage	1
of	1
those	1
lovely	1
trees	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
group	1
of	1
labourers	1
coming	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
vines	1
and	1
that	1
village	1
half	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
oh	1
surely	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
inhabits	1
and	1
guards	1
this	1
place	1
has	1
a	1
soul	1
more	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
man	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
pile	1
the	1
glacier	1
or	1
retire	1
to	1
the	1
inaccessible	1
peaks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
country	1
clerval	1
beloved	1
friend	1
even	1
now	1
it	1
delights	1
me	1
to	1
record	1
your	1
words	1
and	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
eminently	1
deserving	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
being	1
formed	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
poetry	1
of	1
nature	1
his	1
wild	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
imagination	1
was	1
chastened	1
by	1
the	1
sensibility	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
soul	1
overflowed	1
with	1
ardent	1
affections	1
and	1
his	1
friendship	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
devoted	1
and	1
wondrous	1
nature	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
minded	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
but	1
even	1
human	1
sympathies	1
were	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
eager	1
mind	1
the	1
scenery	1
of	1
external	1
nature	1
which	1
others	1
regard	1
only	1
with	1
admiration	1
he	1
loved	1
with	1
ardour	1
the	1
sounding	1
cataract	1
haunted	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
passion	1
the	1
tall	1
rock	1
the	1
mountain	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
gloomy	1
wood	1
their	1
colours	1
and	1
their	1
forms	1
were	1
then	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
appetite	1
a	1
feeling	1
and	1
a	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
remoter	1
charm	1

replete	1
with	1
ideas	1

thus	1
your	1

your	1

visits	1
and	1
consoles	1
your	1
unhappy	1
friend	1
pardon	1
this	1
gush	1
of	1
sorrow	1
these	1
ineffectual	1
words	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
slight	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
unexampled	1
worth	1
of	1
henry	1
but	1
they	1
soothe	1
my	1
heart	1
overflowing	1
with	1
the	1
anguish	1
which	1
his	1
remembrance	1
creates	1
i	1
will	1
proceed	1
with	1
my	1
tale	1
beyond	1
cologne	1
we	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
holland	1
and	1
we	1
resolved	1
to	1
post	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
our	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary	1
and	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
was	1
too	1
gentle	1
to	1
aid	1
us	1
our	1
journey	1
here	1
lost	1
the	1
interest	1
arising	1
from	1
beautiful	1
scenery	1
but	1
we	1
arrived	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
at	1
rotterdam	1
whence	1
we	1
proceeded	1
by	1
sea	1
to	1
england	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
clear	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
december	1
that	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
the	1
white	1
cliffs	1
of	1
britain	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
thames	1
presented	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
they	1
were	1
flat	1
but	1
fertile	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
town	1
was	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
some	1
story	1
we	1
saw	1
tilbury	1
fort	1
and	1
remembered	1
the	1
spanish	1
armada	1
gravesend	1
woolwich	1
and	1
greenwich	1
places	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
country	1
at	1
length	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
numerous	1
steeples	1
of	1
london	1
st	1
paul	1
s	1
towering	1
above	1
all	1
and	1
the	1
tower	1

in	1
english	1
history	1
chapter	1
19	1
london	1
was	1
our	1
present	1
point	1
of	1
rest	1
we	1
determined	1
to	1
remain	1
several	1
months	1
in	1
this	1
wonderful	1
and	1
celebrated	1
city	1
clerval	1
desired	1
the	1
intercourse	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
talent	1
who	1
flourished	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
secondary	1
object	1
i	1
was	1
principally	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
information	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
and	1
quickly	1
availed	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
introduction	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
me	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
natural	1
philosophers	1
if	1
this	1
journey	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
during	1
my	1
days	1
of	1
study	1
and	1
happiness	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
afforded	1
me	1
inexpressible	1
pleasure	1
but	1
a	1
blight	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
my	1
existence	1
and	1
i	1
only	1
visited	1
these	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
information	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
interest	1
was	1
so	1
terribly	1
profound	1
company	1
was	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
alone	1
i	1
could	1
fill	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
sights	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
henry	1
soothed	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
thus	1
cheat	1
myself	1
into	1
a	1
transitory	1
peace	1
but	1
busy	1
uninteresting	1
joyous	1
faces	1
brought	1
back	1
despair	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
i	1
saw	1
an	1
insurmountable	1
barrier	1
placed	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
men	1
this	1
barrier	1
was	1
sealed	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
william	1
and	1
justine	1
and	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
events	1
connected	1
with	1
those	1
names	1
filled	1
my	1
soul	1
with	1
anguish	1
but	1
in	1
clerval	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
self	1
he	1
was	1
inquisitive	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
gain	1
experience	1
and	1
instruction	1
the	1
difference	1
of	1
manners	1
which	1
he	1
observed	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
source	1
of	1
instruction	1
and	1
amusement	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
pursuing	1
an	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
his	1
design	1
was	1
to	1
visit	1
india	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
its	1
various	1
languages	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
views	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
its	1
society	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
materially	1
assisting	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
european	1
colonization	1
and	1
trade	1
in	1
britain	1
only	1
could	1
he	1
further	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
plan	1
he	1
was	1
forever	1
busy	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
check	1
to	1
his	1
enjoyments	1
was	1
my	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
dejected	1
mind	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
this	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
not	1
debar	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
pleasures	1
natural	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
entering	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
of	1
life	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
any	1
care	1
or	1
bitter	1
recollection	1
i	1
often	1
refused	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
alleging	1
another	1
engagement	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
remain	1
alone	1
i	1
now	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
materials	1
necessary	1
for	1
my	1
new	1
creation	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
single	1
drops	1
of	1
water	1
continually	1
falling	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
every	1
thought	1
that	1
was	1
devoted	1
to	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
extreme	1
anguish	1
and	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
i	1
spoke	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
it	1
caused	1
my	1
lips	1
to	1
quiver	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
palpitate	1
after	1
passing	1
some	1
months	1
in	1
london	1
we	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
scotland	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
our	1
visitor	1
at	1
geneva	1
he	1
mentioned	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
asked	1
us	1
if	1
those	1
were	1
not	1
sufficient	1
allurements	1
to	1
induce	1
us	1
to	1
prolong	1
our	1
journey	1
as	1
far	1
north	1
as	1
perth	1
where	1
he	1
resided	1
clerval	1
eagerly	1
desired	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
invitation	1
and	1
i	1
although	1
i	1
abhorred	1
society	1
wished	1
to	1
view	1
again	1
mountains	1
and	1
streams	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wondrous	1
works	1
with	1
which	1
nature	1
adorns	1
her	1
chosen	1
dwelling	1
places	1
we	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
england	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
october	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
february	1
we	1
accordingly	1
determined	1
to	1
commence	1
our	1
journey	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
at	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
another	1
month	1
in	1
this	1
expedition	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
great	1
road	1
to	1
edinburgh	1
but	1
to	1
visit	1
windsor	1
oxford	1
matlock	1
and	1
the	1
cumberland	1
lakes	1
resolving	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
this	1
tour	1
about	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
july	1
i	1
packed	1
up	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
and	1
the	1
materials	1
i	1
had	1
collected	1
resolving	1
to	1
finish	1
my	1
labours	1
in	1
some	1
obscure	1
nook	1
in	1
the	1
northern	1
highlands	1
of	1
scotland	1
we	1
quitted	1
london	1
on	1
the	1
27th	1
of	1
march	1
and	1
remained	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
at	1
windsor	1
rambling	1
in	1
its	1
beautiful	1
forest	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
to	1
us	1
mountaineers	1
the	1
majestic	1
oaks	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
game	1
and	1
the	1
herds	1
of	1
stately	1
deer	1
were	1
all	1
novelties	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
thence	1
we	1
proceeded	1
to	1
oxford	1
as	1
we	1
entered	1
this	1
city	1
our	1
minds	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
transacted	1
there	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
century	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
charles	1
i	1
had	1
collected	1
his	1
forces	1
this	1
city	1
had	1
remained	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
had	1
forsaken	1
his	1
cause	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
parliament	1
and	1
liberty	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
the	1
amiable	1
falkland	1
the	1
insolent	1
goring	1
his	1
queen	1
and	1
son	1
gave	1
a	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
to	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
inhabited	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
elder	1
days	1
found	1
a	1
dwelling	1
here	1
and	1
we	1
delighted	1
to	1

if	1
these	1
feelings	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
an	1
imaginary	1
gratification	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
yet	1
in	1
itself	1
sufficient	1
beauty	1
to	1
obtain	1
our	1
admiration	1
the	1
colleges	1
are	1
ancient	1
and	1
picturesque	1
the	1
streets	1
are	1
almost	1
magnificent	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1

which	1
flows	1
beside	1
it	1
through	1
meadows	1
of	1
exquisite	1
verdure	1
is	1
spread	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
placid	1
expanse	1
of	1
waters	1
which	1
reflects	1
its	1
majestic	1
assemblage	1
of	1
towers	1
and	1
spires	1
and	1
domes	1
embosomed	1
among	1
aged	1
trees	1
i	1
enjoyed	1
this	1
scene	1
and	1
yet	1
my	1
enjoyment	1
was	1
embittered	1
both	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
i	1
was	1
formed	1
for	1
peaceful	1
happiness	1
during	1
my	1
youthful	1
days	1
discontent	1
never	1
visited	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
was	1
ever	1
overcome	1
by	1
ennui	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
beautiful	1
in	1
nature	1
or	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
excellent	1
and	1
sublime	1
in	1
the	1
productions	1
of	1
man	1
could	1
always	1
interest	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
communicate	1
elasticity	1
to	1
my	1
spirits	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
blasted	1
tree	1
the	1
bolt	1
has	1
entered	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
then	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
survive	1
to	1
exhibit	1
what	1
i	1
shall	1
soon	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
miserable	1
spectacle	1
of	1
wrecked	1
humanity	1
pitiable	1
to	1
others	1
and	1
intolerable	1
to	1
myself	1
we	1
passed	1
a	1
considerable	1
period	1
at	1
oxford	1
rambling	1
among	1
its	1
environs	1
and	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
identify	1
every	1
spot	1
which	1
might	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
animating	1
epoch	1
of	1
english	1
history	1
our	1
little	1
voyages	1
of	1
discovery	1
were	1
often	1
prolonged	1
by	1
the	1
successive	1
objects	1
that	1
presented	1
themselves	1
we	1
visited	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
the	1
illustrious	1
hampden	1
and	1
the	1
field	1
on	1
which	1
that	1
patriot	1
fell	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
elevated	1
from	1
its	1
debasing	1
and	1
miserable	1
fears	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
divine	1
ideas	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
self	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
which	1
these	1
sights	1
were	1
the	1
monuments	1
and	1
the	1
remembrancers	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
i	1
dared	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
my	1
chains	1
and	1
look	1
around	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
free	1
and	1
lofty	1
spirit	1
but	1
the	1
iron	1
had	1
eaten	1
into	1
my	1
flesh	1
and	1
i	1
sank	1
again	1
trembling	1
and	1
hopeless	1
into	1
my	1
miserable	1
self	1
we	1
left	1
oxford	1
with	1
regret	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
matlock	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
next	1
place	1
of	1
rest	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
this	1
village	1
resembled	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
the	1
scenery	1
of	1
switzerland	1
but	1
everything	1
is	1
on	1
a	1
lower	1
scale	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
hills	1
want	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
distant	1
white	1
alps	1
which	1
always	1
attend	1
on	1
the	1
piny	1
mountains	1
of	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
we	1
visited	1
the	1
wondrous	1
cave	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
cabinets	1
of	1
natural	1
history	1
where	1
the	1
curiosities	1
are	1
disposed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
collections	1
at	1
servox	1
and	1
chamounix	1
the	1
latter	1
name	1
made	1
me	1
tremble	1
when	1
pronounced	1
by	1
henry	1
and	1
i	1
hastened	1
to	1
quit	1
matlock	1
with	1
which	1
that	1
terrible	1
scene	1
was	1
thus	1
associated	1
from	1
derby	1
still	1
journeying	1
northwards	1
we	1
passed	1
two	1
months	1
in	1
cumberland	1
and	1
westmorland	1
i	1
could	1
now	1
almost	1
fancy	1
myself	1
among	1
the	1
swiss	1
mountains	1
the	1
little	1
patches	1
of	1
snow	1
which	1
yet	1
lingered	1
on	1
the	1
northern	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
lakes	1
and	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
rocky	1
streams	1
were	1
all	1
familiar	1
and	1
dear	1
sights	1
to	1
me	1
here	1
also	1
we	1
made	1
some	1
acquaintances	1
who	1
almost	1
contrived	1
to	1
cheat	1
me	1
into	1
happiness	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
clerval	1
was	1
proportionably	1
greater	1
than	1
mine	1
his	1
mind	1
expanded	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
talent	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
nature	1
greater	1
capacities	1
and	1
resources	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
while	1
he	1
associated	1
with	1
his	1
inferiors	1
i	1
could	1
pass	1
my	1
life	1
here	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
among	1
these	1
mountains	1
i	1
should	1
scarcely	1
regret	1
switzerland	1
and	1
the	1
rhine	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
traveller	1
s	1
life	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
includes	1
much	1
pain	1
amidst	1
its	1
enjoyments	1
his	1
feelings	1
are	1
forever	1
on	1
the	1
stretch	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
begins	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
repose	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
quit	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
rests	1
in	1
pleasure	1
for	1
something	1
new	1
which	1
again	1
engages	1
his	1
attention	1
and	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
forsakes	1
for	1
other	1
novelties	1
we	1
had	1
scarcely	1
visited	1
the	1
various	1
lakes	1
of	1
cumberland	1
and	1
westmorland	1
and	1
conceived	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
when	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
our	1
appointment	1
with	1
our	1
scotch	1
friend	1
approached	1
and	1
we	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
travel	1
on	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
i	1
had	1
now	1
neglected	1
my	1
promise	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
and	1
i	1
feared	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
s	1
disappointment	1
he	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
switzerland	1
and	1
wreak	1
his	1
vengeance	1
on	1
my	1
relatives	1
this	1
idea	1
pursued	1
me	1
and	1
tormented	1
me	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
snatched	1
repose	1
and	1
peace	1
i	1
waited	1
for	1
my	1
letters	1
with	1
feverish	1
impatience	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
delayed	1
i	1
was	1
miserable	1
and	1
overcome	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
fears	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arrived	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
superscription	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
or	1
my	1
father	1
i	1
hardly	1
dared	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
ascertain	1
my	1
fate	1
sometimes	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
followed	1
me	1
and	1
might	1
expedite	1
my	1
remissness	1
by	1
murdering	1
my	1
companion	1
when	1
these	1
thoughts	1
possessed	1
me	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
quit	1
henry	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
followed	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
shadow	1
to	1
protect	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
fancied	1
rage	1
of	1
his	1
destroyer	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
committed	1
some	1
great	1
crime	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
which	1
haunted	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
guiltless	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
indeed	1
drawn	1
down	1
a	1
horrible	1
curse	1
upon	1
my	1
head	1
as	1
mortal	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
crime	1
i	1
visited	1
edinburgh	1
with	1
languid	1
eyes	1
and	1
mind	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
city	1
might	1
have	1
interested	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
being	1
clerval	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
oxford	1
for	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
city	1
was	1
more	1
pleasing	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
regularity	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
town	1
of	1
edinburgh	1
its	1
romantic	1
castle	1
and	1
its	1
environs	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
arthur	1
s	1
seat	1
st	1
bernard	1
s	1
well	1
and	1
the	1
pentland	1
hills	1
compensated	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
change	1
and	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
cheerfulness	1
and	1
admiration	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
we	1
left	1
edinburgh	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
passing	1
through	1
coupar	1
st	1
andrew	1
s	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
tay	1
to	1
perth	1
where	1
our	1
friend	1
expected	1
us	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
to	1
laugh	1
and	1
talk	1
with	1
strangers	1
or	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
feelings	1
or	1
plans	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
humour	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
guest	1
and	1
accordingly	1
i	1
told	1
clerval	1
that	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tour	1
of	1
scotland	1
alone	1
do	1
you	1
said	1
i	1
enjoy	1
yourself	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
be	1
our	1
rendezvous	1
i	1
may	1
be	1
absent	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
two	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
interfere	1
with	1
my	1
motions	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
solitude	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
return	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
lighter	1
heart	1
more	1
congenial	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
temper	1
henry	1
wished	1
to	1
dissuade	1
me	1
but	1
seeing	1
me	1
bent	1
on	1
this	1
plan	1
ceased	1
to	1
remonstrate	1
he	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
often	1
i	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
your	1
solitary	1
rambles	1
than	1
with	1
these	1
scotch	1
people	1
whom	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
hasten	1
then	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
to	1
return	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
again	1
feel	1
myself	1
somewhat	1
at	1
home	1
which	1
i	1
cannot	1
do	1
in	1
your	1
absence	1
having	1
parted	1
from	1
my	1
friend	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
remote	1
spot	1
of	1
scotland	1
and	1
finish	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
solitude	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
monster	1
followed	1
me	1
and	1
would	1
discover	1
himself	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
finished	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
companion	1
with	1
this	1
resolution	1
i	1
traversed	1
the	1
northern	1
highlands	1
and	1
fixed	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
remotest	1
of	1
the	1
orkneys	1
as	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
work	1
being	1
hardly	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
rock	1
whose	1
high	1
sides	1
were	1
continually	1
beaten	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
soil	1
was	1
barren	1
scarcely	1
affording	1
pasture	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
miserable	1
cows	1
and	1
oatmeal	1
for	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
five	1
persons	1
whose	1
gaunt	1
and	1
scraggy	1
limbs	1
gave	1
tokens	1
of	1
their	1
miserable	1
fare	1
vegetables	1
and	1
bread	1
when	1
they	1
indulged	1
in	1
such	1
luxuries	1
and	1
even	1
fresh	1
water	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
procured	1
from	1
the	1
mainland	1
which	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
miles	1
distant	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
island	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
three	1
miserable	1
huts	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
vacant	1
when	1
i	1
arrived	1
this	1
i	1
hired	1
it	1
contained	1
but	1
two	1
rooms	1
and	1
these	1
exhibited	1
all	1
the	1
squalidness	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
penury	1
the	1
thatch	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
unplastered	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
off	1
its	1
hinges	1
i	1
ordered	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
repaired	1
bought	1
some	1
furniture	1
and	1
took	1
possession	1
an	1
incident	1
which	1
would	1
doubtless	1
have	1
occasioned	1
some	1
surprise	1
had	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
been	1
benumbed	1
by	1
want	1
and	1
squalid	1
poverty	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
lived	1
ungazed	1
at	1
and	1
unmolested	1
hardly	1
thanked	1
for	1
the	1
pittance	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
clothes	1
which	1
i	1
gave	1
so	1
much	1
does	1
suffering	1
blunt	1
even	1
the	1
coarsest	1
sensations	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
retreat	1
i	1
devoted	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
labour	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
the	1
weather	1
permitted	1
i	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
stony	1
beach	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
waves	1
as	1
they	1
roared	1
and	1
dashed	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
monotonous	1
yet	1
ever	1
changing	1
scene	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
switzerland	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
different	1
from	1
this	1
desolate	1
and	1
appalling	1
landscape	1
its	1
hills	1
are	1
covered	1
with	1
vines	1
and	1
its	1
cottages	1
are	1
scattered	1
thickly	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
its	1
fair	1
lakes	1
reflect	1
a	1
blue	1
and	1
gentle	1
sky	1
and	1
when	1
troubled	1
by	1
the	1
winds	1
their	1
tumult	1
is	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
a	1
lively	1
infant	1
when	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
roarings	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
ocean	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
i	1
distributed	1
my	1
occupations	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
arrived	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
proceeded	1
in	1
my	1
labour	1
it	1
became	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
horrible	1
and	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
sometimes	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
myself	1
to	1
enter	1
my	1
laboratory	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
i	1
toiled	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
complete	1
my	1
work	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
filthy	1
process	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
engaged	1
during	1
my	1
first	1
experiment	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
frenzy	1
had	1
blinded	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
employment	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
intently	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
my	1
labour	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
proceedings	1
but	1
now	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
cold	1
blood	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
often	1
sickened	1
at	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
thus	1
situated	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
detestable	1
occupation	1
immersed	1
in	1
a	1
solitude	1
where	1
nothing	1
could	1
for	1
an	1

call	1
my	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
actual	1
scene	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
was	1

my	1
spirits	1
became	1
unequal	1
i	1
grew	1
restless	1
and	1
nervous	1
every	1
moment	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
persecutor	1
sometimes	1
i	1
sat	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
fearing	1
to	1
raise	1
them	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
encounter	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
i	1
so	1
much	1
dreaded	1
to	1
behold	1
i	1
feared	1
to	1
wander	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
lest	1
when	1
alone	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
claim	1
his	1
companion	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time	1
i	1
worked	1
on	1
and	1
my	1
labour	1
was	1
already	1
considerably	1
advanced	1
i	1
looked	1
towards	1
its	1
completion	1
with	1
a	1
tremulous	1
and	1
eager	1
hope	1
which	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
trust	1
myself	1
to	1
question	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
intermixed	1
with	1
obscure	1
forebodings	1
of	1
evil	1
that	1
made	1
my	1
heart	1
sicken	1

chapter	1

i	1
sat	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
my	1
laboratory	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
set	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
just	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
sufficient	1
light	1
for	1
my	1
employment	1
and	1
i	1
remained	1
idle	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
consideration	1
of	1
whether	1
i	1
should	1
leave	1
my	1
labour	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
or	1
hasten	1
its	1
conclusion	1
by	1
an	1
unremitting	1
attention	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
i	1
sat	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
reflection	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
what	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
doing	1
three	1
years	1
before	1
i	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
and	1
had	1
created	1
a	1
fiend	1
whose	1
unparalleled	1
barbarity	1
had	1
desolated	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
forever	1
with	1
the	1
bitterest	1
remorse	1
i	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
form	1
another	1
being	1
of	1
whose	1
dispositions	1
i	1
was	1
alike	1
ignorant	1
she	1
might	1
become	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
more	1
malignant	1
than	1
her	1
mate	1
and	1
delight	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
in	1
murder	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
deserts	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
and	1
she	1
who	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
was	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
thinking	1
and	1
reasoning	1
animal	1
might	1
refuse	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
a	1
compact	1
made	1
before	1
her	1
creation	1
they	1
might	1
even	1
hate	1
each	1
other	1
the	1
creature	1
who	1
already	1
lived	1
loathed	1
his	1
own	1
deformity	1
and	1
might	1
he	1
not	1
conceive	1
a	1
greater	1
abhorrence	1
for	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
female	1
form	1
she	1
also	1
might	1
turn	1
with	1
disgust	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
superior	1
beauty	1
of	1
man	1
she	1
might	1
quit	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
again	1
alone	1
exasperated	1
by	1
the	1
fresh	1
provocation	1
of	1
being	1
deserted	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
species	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
leave	1
europe	1
and	1
inhabit	1
the	1
deserts	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
world	1
yet	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
results	1
of	1
those	1
sympathies	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
daemon	1
thirsted	1
would	1
be	1
children	1
and	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
devils	1
would	1
be	1
propagated	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
who	1
might	1
make	1
the	1
very	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
man	1
a	1
condition	1
precarious	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
terror	1
had	1
i	1
right	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
benefit	1
to	1
inflict	1
this	1
curse	1
upon	1
everlasting	1
generations	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
sophisms	1
of	1
the	1
being	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
senseless	1
by	1
his	1
fiendish	1
threats	1
but	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
burst	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
future	1
ages	1
might	1
curse	1
me	1
as	1
their	1
pest	1
whose	1
selfishness	1
had	1
not	1
hesitated	1
to	1
buy	1
its	1
own	1
peace	1
at	1
the	1
price	1
perhaps	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
i	1
trembled	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
failed	1
within	1
me	1
when	1
on	1
looking	1
up	1
i	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
the	1
daemon	1
at	1
the	1
casement	1
a	1
ghastly	1
grin	1
wrinkled	1
his	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
on	1
me	1
where	1
i	1
sat	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
task	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
allotted	1
to	1
me	1
yes	1
he	1
had	1
followed	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
travels	1
he	1
had	1
loitered	1
in	1
forests	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
caves	1
or	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
wide	1
and	1
desert	1
heaths	1
and	1
he	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
mark	1
my	1
progress	1
and	1
claim	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
my	1
promise	1
as	1
i	1
looked	1
on	1
him	1
his	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
treachery	1
i	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
madness	1
on	1
my	1
promise	1
of	1
creating	1
another	1
like	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
trembling	1
with	1
passion	1
tore	1
to	1
pieces	1
the	1
thing	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
engaged	1
the	1
wretch	1
saw	1
me	1
destroy	1
the	1
creature	1
on	1
whose	1
future	1
existence	1
he	1
depended	1
for	1
happiness	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
howl	1
of	1
devilish	1
despair	1
and	1
revenge	1
withdrew	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
locking	1
the	1
door	1
made	1
a	1
solemn	1
vow	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
never	1
to	1
resume	1
my	1
labours	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
trembling	1
steps	1
i	1
sought	1
my	1
own	1
apartment	1
i	1
was	1
alone	1
none	1
were	1
near	1
me	1
to	1
dissipate	1
the	1
gloom	1
and	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sickening	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
reveries	1
several	1
hours	1
passed	1
and	1
i	1
remained	1
near	1
my	1
window	1
gazing	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
motionless	1
for	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
hushed	1
and	1
all	1
nature	1
reposed	1
under	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
moon	1
a	1
few	1
fishing	1
vessels	1
alone	1
specked	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
wafted	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
as	1
the	1
fishermen	1
called	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
silence	1
although	1
i	1
was	1
hardly	1
conscious	1
of	1
its	1
extreme	1
profundity	1
until	1
my	1
ear	1
was	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
paddling	1
of	1
oars	1
near	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
a	1
person	1
landed	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
my	1
door	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
softly	1
i	1
trembled	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
presentiment	1
of	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
rouse	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
cottage	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
mine	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
helplessness	1
so	1
often	1
felt	1
in	1
frightful	1
dreams	1
when	1
you	1
in	1
vain	1
endeavour	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
an	1
impending	1
danger	1
and	1
was	1
rooted	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
presently	1
i	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
the	1
wretch	1
whom	1
i	1
dreaded	1
appeared	1
shutting	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
approached	1
me	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
smothered	1
voice	1
you	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
you	1
began	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
intend	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
break	1
your	1
promise	1
i	1
have	1
endured	1
toil	1
and	1
misery	1
i	1
left	1
switzerland	1
with	1
you	1
i	1
crept	1
along	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
rhine	1
among	1
its	1
willow	1
islands	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
summits	1
of	1
its	1
hills	1
i	1
have	1
dwelt	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
heaths	1
of	1
england	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
deserts	1
of	1
scotland	1
i	1
have	1
endured	1
incalculable	1
fatigue	1
and	1
cold	1
and	1
hunger	1
do	1
you	1
dare	1
destroy	1
my	1
hopes	1
begone	1
i	1
do	1
break	1
my	1
promise	1
never	1
will	1
i	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
yourself	1
equal	1
in	1
deformity	1
and	1
wickedness	1
slave	1
i	1
before	1
reasoned	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
proved	1
yourself	1
unworthy	1
of	1
my	1
condescension	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
power	1
you	1
believe	1
yourself	1
miserable	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
make	1
you	1
so	1
wretched	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
will	1
be	1
hateful	1
to	1
you	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
creator	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
master	1
obey	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
my	1
irresolution	1
is	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
your	1
power	1
is	1
arrived	1
your	1
threats	1
cannot	1
move	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
wickedness	1
but	1
they	1
confirm	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
determination	1
of	1
not	1
creating	1
you	1
a	1
companion	1
in	1
vice	1
shall	1
i	1
in	1
cool	1
blood	1
set	1
loose	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
a	1
daemon	1
whose	1
delight	1
is	1
in	1
death	1
and	1
wretchedness	1
begone	1
i	1
am	1
firm	1
and	1
your	1
words	1
will	1
only	1
exasperate	1
my	1
rage	1
the	1
monster	1
saw	1
my	1
determination	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
and	1
gnashed	1
his	1
teeth	1
in	1
the	1
impotence	1
of	1
anger	1
shall	1
each	1
man	1
cried	1
he	1
find	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
each	1
beast	1
have	1
his	1
mate	1
and	1
i	1
be	1
alone	1
i	1
had	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
requited	1
by	1
detestation	1
and	1
scorn	1
man	1
you	1
may	1
hate	1
but	1
beware	1
your	1
hours	1
will	1
pass	1
in	1
dread	1
and	1
misery	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
bolt	1
will	1
fall	1
which	1
must	1
ravish	1
from	1
you	1
your	1
happiness	1
forever	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
while	1
i	1
grovel	1
in	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
my	1
wretchedness	1
you	1
can	1
blast	1
my	1
other	1
passions	1
but	1
revenge	1
remains	1
revenge	1
henceforth	1
dearer	1
than	1
light	1
or	1
food	1
i	1
may	1
die	1
but	1
first	1
you	1
my	1
tyrant	1
and	1
tormentor	1
shall	1
curse	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
gazes	1
on	1
your	1
misery	1
beware	1
for	1
i	1
am	1
fearless	1
and	1
therefore	1
powerful	1
i	1
will	1
watch	1
with	1
the	1
wiliness	1
of	1
a	1
snake	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
sting	1
with	1
its	1
venom	1
man	1
you	1
shall	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
injuries	1
you	1
inflict	1

cease	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
poison	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
these	1
sounds	1
of	1
malice	1
i	1
have	1
declared	1
my	1
resolution	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
coward	1
to	1
bend	1
beneath	1
words	1
leave	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
inexorable	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
i	1
go	1
but	1
remember	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
i	1
started	1
forward	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
villain	1
before	1
you	1
sign	1
my	1
death	1
warrant	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
yourself	1
safe	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
seized	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
me	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
precipitation	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
boat	1
which	1
shot	1
across	1
the	1
waters	1
with	1
an	1
arrowy	1
swiftness	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
lost	1
amidst	1
the	1
waves	1
all	1
was	1
again	1
silent	1
but	1
his	1
words	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
i	1
burned	1
with	1
rage	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
my	1
peace	1
and	1
precipitate	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ocean	1
i	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
my	1
room	1
hastily	1
and	1
perturbed	1
while	1
my	1
imagination	1
conjured	1
up	1
a	1
thousand	1
images	1
to	1
torment	1
and	1
sting	1
me	1
why	1
had	1
i	1
not	1
followed	1
him	1
and	1
closed	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mortal	1
strife	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
suffered	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
directed	1
his	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
mainland	1
i	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
next	1
victim	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
his	1
insatiate	1
revenge	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
thought	1
again	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
that	1
then	1
was	1
the	1
period	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
my	1
destiny	1
in	1
that	1
hour	1
i	1
should	1
die	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
satisfy	1
and	1
extinguish	1
his	1
malice	1
the	1
prospect	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
me	1
to	1
fear	1
yet	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
elizabeth	1
of	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
endless	1
sorrow	1
when	1
she	1
should	1
find	1
her	1
lover	1
so	1
barbarously	1
snatched	1
from	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
first	1
i	1
had	1
shed	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
streamed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
i	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
before	1
my	1
enemy	1
without	1
a	1
bitter	1
struggle	1
the	1
night	1
passed	1
away	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
ocean	1
my	1
feelings	1
became	1
calmer	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
calmness	1
when	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
rage	1
sinks	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
despair	1
i	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
horrid	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
night	1
s	1
contention	1
and	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
i	1
almost	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
insuperable	1
barrier	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
nay	1
a	1
wish	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
prove	1
the	1
fact	1
stole	1
across	1
me	1
i	1
desired	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
pass	1
my	1
life	1
on	1
that	1
barren	1
rock	1
wearily	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
but	1
uninterrupted	1
by	1
any	1
sudden	1
shock	1
of	1
misery	1
if	1
i	1
returned	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
or	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
whom	1
i	1
most	1
loved	1
die	1
under	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
a	1
daemon	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
myself	1
created	1
i	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
isle	1
like	1
a	1
restless	1
spectre	1
separated	1
from	1
all	1
it	1
loved	1
and	1
miserable	1
in	1
the	1
separation	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
noon	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
higher	1
i	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
awake	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
my	1
nerves	1
were	1
agitated	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
inflamed	1
by	1
watching	1
and	1
misery	1
the	1
sleep	1
into	1
which	1
i	1
now	1
sank	1
refreshed	1
me	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
awoke	1
i	1
again	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
like	1
myself	1
and	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
upon	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
with	1
greater	1
composure	1
yet	1
still	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
rang	1
in	1
my	1
ears	1
like	1
a	1
death	1
knell	1
they	1
appeared	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
yet	1
distinct	1
and	1
oppressive	1
as	1
a	1
reality	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
far	1
descended	1
and	1
i	1
still	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
satisfying	1
my	1
appetite	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
ravenous	1
with	1
an	1
oaten	1
cake	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
fishing	1
boat	1
land	1
close	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
packet	1
it	1
contained	1
letters	1
from	1
geneva	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
clerval	1
entreating	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wearing	1
away	1
his	1
time	1
fruitlessly	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
friends	1
he	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
london	1
desired	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
negotiation	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
for	1
his	1
indian	1
enterprise	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
delay	1
his	1
departure	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
london	1
might	1
be	1
followed	1
even	1
sooner	1
than	1
he	1
now	1
conjectured	1
by	1
his	1
longer	1
voyage	1
he	1
entreated	1
me	1
to	1
bestow	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
my	1
society	1
on	1
him	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
spare	1
he	1
besought	1
me	1
therefore	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
solitary	1
isle	1
and	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
perth	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
proceed	1
southwards	1
together	1
this	1
letter	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
recalled	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
i	1
determined	1
to	1
quit	1
my	1
island	1
at	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
yet	1
before	1
i	1
departed	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
task	1
to	1
perform	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
shuddered	1
to	1
reflect	1
i	1
must	1
pack	1
up	1
my	1
chemical	1
instruments	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
i	1
must	1
enter	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
my	1
odious	1
work	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
handle	1
those	1
utensils	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
sickening	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
at	1
daybreak	1
i	1
summoned	1
sufficient	1
courage	1
and	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
laboratory	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
finished	1
creature	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
destroyed	1
lay	1
scattered	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
i	1
almost	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
had	1
mangled	1
the	1
living	1
flesh	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
i	1
paused	1
to	1
collect	1
myself	1
and	1
then	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
with	1
trembling	1
hand	1
i	1
conveyed	1
the	1
instruments	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
i	1
reflected	1
that	1
i	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
relics	1
of	1
my	1
work	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
horror	1
and	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
and	1
i	1
accordingly	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
basket	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
laying	1
them	1
up	1
determined	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
very	1
night	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
i	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
employed	1
in	1
cleaning	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
chemical	1
apparatus	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
complete	1
than	1
the	1
alteration	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
feelings	1
since	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
regarded	1
my	1
promise	1
with	1
a	1
gloomy	1
despair	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
with	1
whatever	1
consequences	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
but	1
i	1
now	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
film	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
saw	1
clearly	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
renewing	1
my	1
labours	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
occur	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
threat	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
weighed	1
on	1
my	1
thoughts	1
but	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
reflect	1
that	1
a	1
voluntary	1
act	1
of	1
mine	1
could	1
avert	1
it	1
i	1
had	1
resolved	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
to	1
create	1
another	1
like	1
the	1
fiend	1
i	1
had	1
first	1
made	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
basest	1
and	1
most	1
atrocious	1
selfishness	1
and	1
i	1
banished	1
from	1
my	1
mind	1
every	1
thought	1
that	1
could	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
conclusion	1
between	1
two	1
and	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
moon	1
rose	1
and	1
i	1
then	1
putting	1
my	1
basket	1
aboard	1
a	1
little	1
skiff	1
sailed	1
out	1
about	1
four	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
the	1
scene	1
was	1
perfectly	1
solitary	1
a	1
few	1
boats	1
were	1
returning	1
towards	1
land	1
but	1
i	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
a	1
dreadful	1
crime	1
and	1
avoided	1
with	1
shuddering	1
anxiety	1
any	1
encounter	1
with	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
the	1
moon	1
which	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
clear	1
was	1
suddenly	1
overspread	1
by	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud	1
and	1
i	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
cast	1
my	1
basket	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
i	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
gurgling	1
sound	1
as	1
it	1
sank	1
and	1
then	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
the	1
sky	1
became	1
clouded	1
but	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
pure	1
although	1
chilled	1
by	1
the	1
northeast	1
breeze	1
that	1
was	1
then	1
rising	1
but	1
it	1
refreshed	1
me	1
and	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
agreeable	1
sensations	1
that	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
prolong	1
my	1
stay	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
fixing	1
the	1
rudder	1
in	1
a	1
direct	1
position	1
stretched	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
clouds	1
hid	1
the	1
moon	1
everything	1
was	1
obscure	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
only	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
its	1
keel	1
cut	1
through	1
the	1
waves	1
the	1
murmur	1
lulled	1
me	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
i	1
slept	1
soundly	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
i	1
remained	1
in	1
this	1
situation	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
awoke	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
already	1
mounted	1
considerably	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
high	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
continually	1
threatened	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
skiff	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
northeast	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
driven	1
me	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
coast	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
embarked	1
i	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
course	1
but	1
quickly	1
found	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
again	1
made	1
the	1
attempt	1
the	1
boat	1
would	1
be	1
instantly	1
filled	1
with	1
water	1
thus	1
situated	1
my	1
only	1
resource	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
i	1
confess	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
few	1
sensations	1
of	1
terror	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
compass	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
slenderly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
geography	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
of	1
little	1
benefit	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
might	1
be	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
atlantic	1
and	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
starvation	1
or	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
immeasurable	1
waters	1
that	1
roared	1
and	1
buffeted	1
around	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
out	1
many	1
hours	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
thirst	1
a	1
prelude	1
to	1
my	1
other	1
sufferings	1
i	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
heavens	1
which	1
were	1
covered	1
by	1
clouds	1
that	1
flew	1
before	1
the	1
wind	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
replaced	1
by	1
others	1
i	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
grave	1
fiend	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
your	1
task	1
is	1
already	1
fulfilled	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
clerval	1
all	1
left	1
behind	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
monster	1
might	1
satisfy	1
his	1
sanguinary	1
and	1
merciless	1
passions	1
this	1
idea	1
plunged	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
so	1
despairing	1
and	1
frightful	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
scene	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
closing	1
before	1
me	1
forever	1
i	1
shudder	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
it	1
some	1
hours	1
passed	1
thus	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
declined	1
towards	1
the	1
horizon	1
the	1
wind	1
died	1
away	1
into	1
a	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
free	1
from	1
breakers	1
but	1
these	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
a	1
heavy	1
swell	1
i	1
felt	1
sick	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
rudder	1
when	1
suddenly	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
high	1
land	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
almost	1
spent	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
by	1
fatigue	1
and	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspense	1
i	1
endured	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
this	1
sudden	1
certainty	1
of	1
life	1
rushed	1
like	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
warm	1
joy	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
tears	1
gushed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
how	1
mutable	1
are	1
our	1
feelings	1
and	1
how	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
clinging	1
love	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
life	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
misery	1
i	1
constructed	1
another	1
sail	1
with	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
dress	1
and	1
eagerly	1
steered	1
my	1
course	1
towards	1
the	1
land	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
wild	1
and	1
rocky	1
appearance	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
approached	1
nearer	1
i	1
easily	1
perceived	1
the	1
traces	1
of	1
cultivation	1
i	1
saw	1
vessels	1
near	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
suddenly	1
transported	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
civilized	1
man	1
i	1
carefully	1
traced	1
the	1
windings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
hailed	1
a	1
steeple	1
which	1
i	1
at	1
length	1
saw	1
issuing	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
small	1
promontory	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
extreme	1
debility	1
i	1
resolved	1
to	1
sail	1
directly	1
towards	1
the	1
town	1
as	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
could	1
most	1
easily	1
procure	1
nourishment	1
fortunately	1
i	1
had	1
money	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
turned	1
the	1
promontory	1
i	1
perceived	1
a	1
small	1
neat	1
town	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
harbour	1
which	1
i	1
entered	1
my	1
heart	1
bounding	1
with	1
joy	1
at	1
my	1
unexpected	1
escape	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
fixing	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
arranging	1
the	1
sails	1
several	1
people	1
crowded	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
they	1
seemed	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
appearance	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
offering	1
me	1
any	1
assistance	1
whispered	1
together	1
with	1
gestures	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time	1
might	1
have	1
produced	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
slight	1
sensation	1
of	1
alarm	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
i	1
merely	1
remarked	1
that	1
they	1
spoke	1
english	1
and	1
i	1
therefore	1
addressed	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
language	1
my	1
good	1
friends	1
said	1
i	1
will	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
town	1
and	1
inform	1
me	1
where	1
i	1
am	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
that	1
soon	1
enough	1
replied	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
maybe	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
prove	1
much	1
to	1
your	1
taste	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
consulted	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
quarters	1
i	1
promise	1
you	1
i	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
surprised	1
on	1
receiving	1
so	1
rude	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
also	1
disconcerted	1
on	1
perceiving	1
the	1
frowning	1
and	1
angry	1
countenances	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
answer	1
me	1
so	1
roughly	1
i	1
replied	1
surely	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
englishmen	1
to	1
receive	1
strangers	1
so	1
inhospitably	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
what	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
english	1
may	1
be	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
irish	1
to	1
hate	1
villains	1
while	1
this	1
strange	1
dialogue	1
continued	1
i	1
perceived	1
the	1
crowd	1
rapidly	1
increase	1
their	1
faces	1
expressed	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
anger	1
which	1
annoyed	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
alarmed	1
me	1
i	1
inquired	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
replied	1
i	1
then	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
a	1
murmuring	1
sound	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
crowd	1
as	1
they	1
followed	1
and	1
surrounded	1
me	1
when	1
an	1
ill	1
looking	1
man	1
approaching	1
tapped	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
said	1
come	1
sir	1
you	1
must	1
follow	1
me	1
to	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
s	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
yourself	1
who	1
is	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
why	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
myself	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
free	1
country	1
ay	1
sir	1
free	1
enough	1
for	1
honest	1
folks	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
is	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
was	1
found	1
murdered	1
here	1
last	1
night	1
this	1
answer	1
startled	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
presently	1
recovered	1
myself	1
i	1
was	1
innocent	1
that	1
could	1
easily	1
be	1
proved	1
accordingly	1
i	1
followed	1
my	1
conductor	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
i	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
sink	1
from	1
fatigue	1
and	1
hunger	1
but	1
being	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
crowd	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
politic	1
to	1
rouse	1
all	1
my	1
strength	1
that	1
no	1
physical	1
debility	1
might	1
be	1
construed	1
into	1
apprehension	1
or	1
conscious	1
guilt	1
little	1
did	1
i	1
then	1
expect	1
the	1
calamity	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
to	1
overwhelm	1
me	1
and	1
extinguish	1
in	1
horror	1
and	1
despair	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
ignominy	1
or	1
death	1
i	1
must	1
pause	1
here	1
for	1
it	1
requires	1
all	1
my	1
fortitude	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
events	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
relate	1
in	1
proper	1
detail	1
to	1
my	1
recollection	1
chapter	1
21	1
i	1
was	1
soon	1
introduced	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
an	1
old	1
benevolent	1
man	1
with	1
calm	1
and	1
mild	1
manners	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
me	1
however	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
severity	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
towards	1
my	1
conductors	1
he	1
asked	1
who	1
appeared	1
as	1
witnesses	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
men	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
one	1
being	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
magistrate	1
he	1
deposed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
fishing	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
brother	1
in	1
law	1
daniel	1
nugent	1
when	1
about	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
they	1
observed	1
a	1
strong	1
northerly	1
blast	1
rising	1
and	1
they	1
accordingly	1
put	1
in	1
for	1
port	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
dark	1
night	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
risen	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
land	1
at	1
the	1
harbour	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
at	1
a	1
creek	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
below	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
first	1
carrying	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
fishing	1
tackle	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
followed	1
him	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
proceeding	1
along	1
the	1
sands	1
he	1
struck	1
his	1
foot	1
against	1
something	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
length	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
his	1
companions	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
their	1
lantern	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
dead	1
their	1
first	1
supposition	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
some	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
drowned	1
and	1
was	1
thrown	1
on	1
shore	1
by	1
the	1
waves	1
but	1
on	1
examination	1
they	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
clothes	1
were	1
not	1
wet	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
was	1
not	1
then	1
cold	1
they	1
instantly	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
life	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
strangled	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
violence	1
except	1
the	1
black	1
mark	1
of	1
fingers	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
deposition	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
fingers	1
was	1
mentioned	1
i	1
remembered	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
and	1
felt	1
myself	1
extremely	1
agitated	1
my	1
limbs	1
trembled	1
and	1
a	1
mist	1
came	1
over	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
lean	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
support	1
the	1
magistrate	1
observed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
keen	1
eye	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
drew	1
an	1
unfavourable	1
augury	1
from	1
my	1
manner	1
the	1
son	1
confirmed	1
his	1
father	1
s	1
account	1
but	1
when	1
daniel	1
nugent	1
was	1
called	1
he	1
swore	1
positively	1
that	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
stars	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
boat	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
just	1
landed	1
a	1
woman	1
deposed	1
that	1
she	1
lived	1
near	1
the	1
beach	1
and	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
cottage	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
push	1
off	1
from	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
was	1
afterwards	1
found	1
another	1
woman	1
confirmed	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
body	1
into	1
her	1
house	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
cold	1
they	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
rubbed	1
it	1
and	1
daniel	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
for	1
an	1
apothecary	1
but	1
life	1
was	1
quite	1
gone	1
several	1
other	1
men	1
were	1
examined	1
concerning	1
my	1
landing	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
strong	1
north	1
wind	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
beaten	1
about	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
return	1
nearly	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
departed	1
besides	1
they	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
body	1
from	1
another	1
place	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
likely	1
that	1
as	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
shore	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
harbour	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
had	1
deposited	1
the	1
corpse	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
evidence	1
desired	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
lay	1
for	1
interment	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
observed	1
what	1
effect	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
produce	1
upon	1
me	1
this	1
idea	1
was	1
probably	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
extreme	1
agitation	1
i	1
had	1
exhibited	1
when	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
the	1
murder	1
had	1
been	1
described	1
i	1
was	1
accordingly	1
conducted	1
by	1
the	1
magistrate	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
persons	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
coincidences	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
during	1
this	1
eventful	1
night	1
but	1
knowing	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
conversing	1
with	1
several	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
i	1
had	1
inhabited	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
i	1
was	1
perfectly	1
tranquil	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
i	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
lay	1
and	1
was	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
coffin	1
how	1
can	1
i	1
describe	1
my	1
sensations	1
on	1
beholding	1
it	1
i	1
feel	1
yet	1
parched	1
with	1
horror	1
nor	1
can	1
i	1
reflect	1
on	1
that	1
terrible	1
moment	1
without	1
shuddering	1
and	1
agony	1
the	1
examination	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
and	1
witnesses	1
passed	1
like	1
a	1
dream	1
from	1
my	1
memory	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
henry	1
clerval	1
stretched	1
before	1
me	1
i	1
gasped	1
for	1
breath	1
and	1
throwing	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
i	1
exclaimed	1
have	1
my	1
murderous	1
machinations	1
deprived	1
you	1
also	1
my	1
dearest	1
henry	1
of	1
life	1
two	1
i	1
have	1
already	1
destroyed	1
other	1
victims	1
await	1
their	1
destiny	1
but	1
you	1
clerval	1
my	1
friend	1
my	1
benefactor	1
the	1
human	1
frame	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
support	1
the	1
agonies	1
that	1
i	1
endured	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
strong	1
convulsions	1
a	1
fever	1
succeeded	1
to	1
this	1
i	1
lay	1
for	1
two	1
months	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
my	1
ravings	1
as	1
i	1
afterwards	1
heard	1
were	1
frightful	1
i	1
called	1
myself	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
william	1
of	1
justine	1
and	1
of	1
clerval	1
sometimes	1
i	1
entreated	1
my	1
attendants	1
to	1
assist	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
by	1
whom	1
i	1
was	1
tormented	1
and	1
at	1
others	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
fingers	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
already	1
grasping	1
my	1
neck	1
and	1
screamed	1
aloud	1
with	1
agony	1
and	1
terror	1
fortunately	1
as	1
i	1
spoke	1
my	1
native	1
language	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
alone	1
understood	1
me	1
but	1
my	1
gestures	1
and	1
bitter	1
cries	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
affright	1
the	1
other	1
witnesses	1
why	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
die	1
more	1
miserable	1
than	1
man	1
ever	1
was	1
before	1
why	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
sink	1
into	1
forgetfulness	1
and	1
rest	1
death	1
snatches	1
away	1
many	1
blooming	1
children	1
the	1
only	1
hopes	1
of	1
their	1
doting	1
parents	1
how	1
many	1
brides	1
and	1
youthful	1
lovers	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
health	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
a	1
prey	1
for	1
worms	1
and	1
the	1
decay	1
of	1
the	1
tomb	1
of	1
what	1
materials	1
was	1
i	1
made	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
thus	1
resist	1
so	1
many	1
shocks	1
which	1
like	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
wheel	1
continually	1
renewed	1
the	1
torture	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
doomed	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
months	1
found	1
myself	1
as	1
awaking	1
from	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
a	1
prison	1
stretched	1
on	1
a	1
wretched	1
bed	1
surrounded	1
by	1
jailers	1
turnkeys	1
bolts	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
miserable	1
apparatus	1
of	1
a	1
dungeon	1
it	1
was	1
morning	1
i	1
remember	1
when	1
i	1
thus	1
awoke	1
to	1
understanding	1
i	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
only	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
great	1
misfortune	1
had	1
suddenly	1
overwhelmed	1
me	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
looked	1
around	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
barred	1
windows	1
and	1
the	1
squalidness	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
all	1
flashed	1
across	1
my	1
memory	1
and	1
i	1
groaned	1
bitterly	1
this	1
sound	1
disturbed	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
sleeping	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
beside	1
me	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
hired	1
nurse	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
turnkeys	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
all	1
those	1
bad	1
qualities	1
which	1
often	1
characterize	1
that	1
class	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
were	1
hard	1
and	1
rude	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
persons	1
accustomed	1
to	1
see	1
without	1
sympathizing	1
in	1
sights	1
of	1
misery	1
her	1
tone	1
expressed	1
her	1
entire	1
indifference	1
she	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
english	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
heard	1
during	1
my	1
sufferings	1
are	1
you	1
better	1
now	1
sir	1
said	1
she	1
i	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
language	1
with	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
i	1
believe	1
i	1
am	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
true	1
if	1
indeed	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
dream	1
i	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
still	1
alive	1
to	1
feel	1
this	1
misery	1
and	1
horror	1
for	1
that	1
matter	1
replied	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
if	1
you	1
mean	1
about	1
the	1
gentleman	1
you	1
murdered	1
i	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
dead	1
for	1
i	1
fancy	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
with	1
you	1
however	1
that	1
s	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
business	1
i	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
nurse	1
you	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
well	1
i	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
with	1
a	1
safe	1
conscience	1
it	1
were	1
well	1
if	1
everybody	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
i	1
turned	1
with	1
loathing	1
from	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
utter	1
so	1
unfeeling	1
a	1
speech	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
just	1
saved	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
death	1
but	1
i	1
felt	1
languid	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
i	1
sometimes	1
doubted	1
if	1
indeed	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
true	1
for	1
it	1
never	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
reality	1
as	1
the	1
images	1
that	1
floated	1
before	1
me	1
became	1
more	1
distinct	1
i	1
grew	1
feverish	1
a	1
darkness	1
pressed	1
around	1
me	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
near	1
me	1
who	1
soothed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
gentle	1
voice	1
of	1
love	1
no	1
dear	1
hand	1
supported	1
me	1
the	1
physician	1
came	1
and	1
prescribed	1
medicines	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
prepared	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
utter	1
carelessness	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
brutality	1
was	1
strongly	1
marked	1
in	1
the	1
visage	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
a	1
murderer	1
but	1
the	1
hangman	1
who	1
would	1
gain	1
his	1
fee	1
these	1
were	1
my	1
first	1
reflections	1
but	1
i	1
soon	1
learned	1
that	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
had	1
shown	1
me	1
extreme	1
kindness	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
best	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
me	1
wretched	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
provided	1
a	1
physician	1
and	1
a	1
nurse	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
seldom	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
for	1
although	1
he	1
ardently	1
desired	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
every	1
human	1
creature	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
agonies	1
and	1
miserable	1
ravings	1
of	1
a	1
murderer	1
he	1
came	1
therefore	1
sometimes	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
neglected	1
but	1
his	1
visits	1
were	1
short	1
and	1
with	1
long	1
intervals	1
one	1
day	1
while	1
i	1
was	1
gradually	1
recovering	1
i	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
my	1
eyes	1
half	1
open	1
and	1
my	1
cheeks	1
livid	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
death	1
i	1
was	1
overcome	1
by	1
gloom	1
and	1
misery	1
and	1
often	1
reflected	1
i	1
had	1
better	1
seek	1
death	1
than	1
desire	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
a	1
world	1
which	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
replete	1
with	1
wretchedness	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
i	1
considered	1
whether	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
declare	1
myself	1
guilty	1
and	1
suffer	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
less	1
innocent	1
than	1
poor	1
justine	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
were	1
my	1
thoughts	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
apartment	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
entered	1
his	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
sympathy	1
and	1
compassion	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
mine	1
and	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
french	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
very	1
shocking	1
to	1
you	1
can	1
i	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
more	1
comfortable	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
mention	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
comfort	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
capable	1
of	1
receiving	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
a	1
stranger	1
can	1
be	1
but	1
of	1
little	1
relief	1
to	1
one	1
borne	1
down	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
by	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
misfortune	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
i	1
hope	1
soon	1
quit	1
this	1
melancholy	1
abode	1
for	1
doubtless	1
evidence	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
free	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
criminal	1
charge	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
least	1
concern	1
i	1
am	1
by	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
strange	1
events	1
become	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
of	1
mortals	1
persecuted	1
and	1
tortured	1
as	1
i	1
am	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
can	1
death	1
be	1
any	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
nothing	1
indeed	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
agonizing	1
than	1
the	1
strange	1
chances	1
that	1
have	1
lately	1
occurred	1
you	1
were	1
thrown	1
by	1
some	1
surprising	1
accident	1
on	1
this	1
shore	1
renowned	1
for	1
its	1
hospitality	1
seized	1
immediately	1
and	1
charged	1
with	1
murder	1
the	1
first	1
sight	1
that	1
was	1
presented	1
to	1
your	1
eyes	1
was	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
your	1
friend	1
murdered	1
in	1
so	1
unaccountable	1
a	1
manner	1
and	1
placed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
some	1
fiend	1
across	1
your	1
path	1
as	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
said	1
this	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
agitation	1
i	1
endured	1
on	1
this	1
retrospect	1
of	1
my	1
sufferings	1
i	1
also	1
felt	1
considerable	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
knowledge	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
possess	1
concerning	1
me	1
i	1
suppose	1
some	1
astonishment	1
was	1
exhibited	1
in	1
my	1
countenance	1
for	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
hastened	1
to	1
say	1
immediately	1
upon	1
your	1
being	1
taken	1
ill	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
your	1
person	1
were	1
brought	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
examined	1
them	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
discover	1
some	1
trace	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
send	1
to	1
your	1
relations	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
your	1
misfortune	1
and	1
illness	1
i	1
found	1
several	1
letters	1
and	1
among	1
others	1
one	1
which	1
i	1
discovered	1
from	1
its	1
commencement	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
your	1
father	1
i	1
instantly	1
wrote	1
to	1
geneva	1
nearly	1
two	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
my	1
letter	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
ill	1
even	1
now	1
you	1
tremble	1
you	1
are	1
unfit	1
for	1
agitation	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
this	1
suspense	1
is	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
event	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
new	1
scene	1
of	1
death	1
has	1
been	1
acted	1
and	1
whose	1
murder	1
i	1
am	1
now	1
to	1
lament	1
your	1
family	1
is	1
perfectly	1
well	1
said	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
with	1
gentleness	1
and	1
someone	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
visit	1
you	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
by	1
what	1
chain	1
of	1
thought	1
the	1
idea	1
presented	1
itself	1
but	1
it	1
instantly	1
darted	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
murderer	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
mock	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
and	1
taunt	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
clerval	1
as	1
a	1
new	1
incitement	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
hellish	1
desires	1
i	1
put	1
my	1
hand	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
agony	1
oh	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
i	1
cannot	1
see	1
him	1
for	1
god	1
s	1
sake	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
enter	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
regarded	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
troubled	1
countenance	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
regarding	1
my	1
exclamation	1
as	1
a	1
presumption	1
of	1
my	1
guilt	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
rather	1
a	1
severe	1
tone	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
welcome	1
instead	1
of	1
inspiring	1
such	1
violent	1
repugnance	1
my	1
father	1
cried	1
i	1
while	1
every	1
feature	1
and	1
every	1
muscle	1
was	1
relaxed	1
from	1
anguish	1
to	1
pleasure	1
is	1
my	1
father	1
indeed	1
come	1
how	1
kind	1
how	1
very	1
kind	1
but	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
not	1
hasten	1
to	1
me	1
my	1
change	1
of	1
manner	1
surprised	1
and	1
pleased	1
the	1
magistrate	1
perhaps	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
my	1
former	1
exclamation	1
was	1
a	1
momentary	1
return	1
of	1
delirium	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
instantly	1
resumed	1
his	1
former	1
benevolence	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
my	1
nurse	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
it	1
nothing	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
than	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
i	1
stretched	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
cried	1
are	1
you	1
then	1
safe	1
and	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
ernest	1
my	1
father	1
calmed	1
me	1
with	1
assurances	1
of	1
their	1
welfare	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
these	1
subjects	1
so	1
interesting	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
raise	1
my	1
desponding	1
spirits	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
felt	1
that	1
a	1
prison	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
abode	1
of	1
cheerfulness	1
what	1
a	1
place	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
you	1
inhabit	1
my	1
son	1
said	1
he	1
looking	1
mournfully	1
at	1
the	1
barred	1
windows	1
and	1
wretched	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
you	1
travelled	1
to	1
seek	1
happiness	1
but	1
a	1
fatality	1
seems	1
to	1
pursue	1
you	1
and	1
poor	1
clerval	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
murdered	1
friend	1
was	1
an	1
agitation	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
be	1
endured	1
in	1
my	1
weak	1
state	1
i	1
shed	1
tears	1
alas	1
yes	1
my	1
father	1
replied	1
i	1
some	1
destiny	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
kind	1
hangs	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
live	1
to	1
fulfil	1
it	1
or	1
surely	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
died	1
on	1
the	1
coffin	1
of	1
henry	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
allowed	1
to	1
converse	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
precarious	1
state	1
of	1
my	1
health	1
rendered	1
every	1
precaution	1
necessary	1
that	1
could	1
ensure	1
tranquillity	1
mr	1
kirwin	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
insisted	1
that	1
my	1
strength	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
exhausted	1
by	1
too	1
much	1
exertion	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
angel	1
and	1
i	1
gradually	1
recovered	1
my	1
health	1
as	1
my	1
sickness	1
quitted	1
me	1
i	1
was	1
absorbed	1
by	1
a	1
gloomy	1
and	1
black	1
melancholy	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
dissipate	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
clerval	1
was	1
forever	1
before	1
me	1
ghastly	1
and	1
murdered	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
the	1
agitation	1
into	1
which	1
these	1
reflections	1
threw	1
me	1
made	1
my	1
friends	1
dread	1
a	1
dangerous	1
relapse	1
alas	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
preserve	1
so	1
miserable	1
and	1
detested	1
a	1
life	1
it	1
was	1
surely	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
fulfil	1
my	1
destiny	1
which	1
is	1
now	1
drawing	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
soon	1
oh	1
very	1
soon	1
will	1
death	1
extinguish	1
these	1
throbbings	1
and	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
mighty	1
weight	1
of	1
anguish	1
that	1
bears	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
in	1
executing	1
the	1
award	1
of	1
justice	1
i	1
shall	1
also	1
sink	1
to	1
rest	1
then	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
death	1
was	1
distant	1
although	1
the	1
wish	1
was	1
ever	1
present	1
to	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
sat	1
for	1
hours	1
motionless	1
and	1
speechless	1
wishing	1
for	1
some	1
mighty	1
revolution	1
that	1
might	1
bury	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
destroyer	1
in	1
its	1
ruins	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
the	1
assizes	1
approached	1
i	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
three	1
months	1
in	1

although	1
i	1
was	1
still	1
weak	1
and	1
in	1
continual	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
relapse	1
i	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
travel	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
miles	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
town	1
where	1
the	1
court	1
was	1

mr	1
kirwin	1
charged	1
himself	1
with	1
every	1
care	1
of	1
collecting	1
witnesses	1
and	1
arranging	1
my	1
defence	1
i	1
was	1
spared	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
appearing	1
publicly	1
as	1
a	1
criminal	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
before	1

that	1
decides	1
on	1

death	1
the	1
grand	1
jury	1
rejected	1

bill	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
proved	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
orkney	1
islands	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
was	1
found	1
and	1
a	1
fortnight	1
after	1
my	1
removal	1
i	1
was	1
liberated	1
from	1
prison	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
enraptured	1
on	1
finding	1
me	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
vexations	1
of	1
a	1
criminal	1
charge	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
again	1
allowed	1
to	1
breathe	1
the	1
fresh	1
atmosphere	1
and	1
permitted	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
participate	1
in	1
these	1
feelings	1
for	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
dungeon	1
or	1
a	1
palace	1
were	1
alike	1
hateful	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
poisoned	1
forever	1
and	1
although	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
happy	1
and	1
gay	1
of	1
heart	1
i	1
saw	1
around	1
me	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
dense	1
and	1
frightful	1
darkness	1
penetrated	1
by	1
no	1
light	1
but	1
the	1
glimmer	1
of	1
two	1
eyes	1
that	1
glared	1
upon	1
me	1
sometimes	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
expressive	1
eyes	1
of	1
henry	1
languishing	1
in	1
death	1
the	1
dark	1
orbs	1
nearly	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
lids	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
black	1
lashes	1
that	1
fringed	1
them	1
sometimes	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
watery	1
clouded	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
as	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
chamber	1
at	1
ingolstadt	1
my	1
father	1
tried	1
to	1
awaken	1
in	1
me	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
affection	1
he	1
talked	1
of	1
geneva	1
which	1
i	1
should	1
soon	1
visit	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
ernest	1
but	1
these	1
words	1
only	1
drew	1
deep	1
groans	1
from	1
me	1
sometimes	1
indeed	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
for	1
happiness	1
and	1
thought	1
with	1
melancholy	1
delight	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
cousin	1
or	1
longed	1
with	1
a	1
devouring	1
maladie	1
du	1
pays	1
to	1
see	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
blue	1
lake	1
and	1
rapid	1
rhone	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
early	1
childhood	1
but	1
my	1
general	1
state	1
of	1
feeling	1
was	1
a	1
torpor	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
prison	1
was	1
as	1
welcome	1
a	1
residence	1
as	1
the	1
divinest	1
scene	1
in	1
nature	1
and	1
these	1
fits	1
were	1
seldom	1
interrupted	1
but	1
by	1
paroxysms	1
of	1
anguish	1
and	1
despair	1
at	1
these	1
moments	1
i	1
often	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
i	1
loathed	1
and	1
it	1
required	1
unceasing	1
attendance	1
and	1
vigilance	1
to	1
restrain	1
me	1
from	1
committing	1
some	1
dreadful	1
act	1
of	1
violence	1
yet	1
one	1
duty	1
remained	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
which	1
finally	1
triumphed	1
over	1
my	1
selfish	1
despair	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
return	1
without	1
delay	1
to	1
geneva	1
there	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
those	1
i	1
so	1
fondly	1
loved	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
murderer	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
chance	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
his	1
concealment	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
dared	1
again	1
to	1
blast	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
presence	1
i	1
might	1
with	1
unfailing	1
aim	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
monstrous	1
image	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
endued	1
with	1
the	1
mockery	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
still	1
more	1
monstrous	1
my	1
father	1
still	1
desired	1
to	1
delay	1
our	1
departure	1
fearful	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sustain	1
the	1
fatigues	1
of	1
a	1
journey	1
for	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
shattered	1
wreck	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
my	1
strength	1
was	1
gone	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
skeleton	1
and	1
fever	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
preyed	1
upon	1
my	1
wasted	1
frame	1
still	1
as	1
i	1
urged	1
our	1
leaving	1
ireland	1
with	1
such	1
inquietude	1
and	1
impatience	1
my	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
yield	1

our	1
passage	1
on	1

midnight	1
i	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1

looking	1
at	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
dashing	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
i	1
hailed	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
shut	1
ireland	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
and	1
my	1
pulse	1
beat	1
with	1
a	1
feverish	1
joy	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
soon	1
see	1

past	1

to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
frightful	1
dream	1
yet	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
blew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
detested	1
shore	1
of	1
ireland	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
which	1
surrounded	1
me	1
told	1
me	1
too	1
forcibly	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
deceived	1
by	1
no	1
vision	1
and	1
that	1
clerval	1
my	1

fallen	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
me	1

the	1
monster	1

in	1
my	1
memory	1

whole	1
life	1
my	1
quiet	1
happiness	1
while	1
residing	1
with	1
my	1

the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
departure	1
for	1
ingolstadt	1

remembered	1
shuddering	1
the	1
mad	1
enthusiasm	1
that	1
hurried	1
me	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
my	1
hideous	1
enemy	1
and	1
i	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
first	1
lived	1
i	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1

the	1
train	1
of	1

a	1
thousand	1
feelings	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1

i	1
wept	1
bitterly	1
ever	1
since	1
my	1
recovery	1
from	1
the	1
fever	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
taking	1
every	1
night	1
a	1
small	1
quantity	1
of	1
laudanum	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
drug	1

that	1
i	1
was	1

gain	1
the	1

the	1
preservation	1
of	1
life	1

by	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
my	1
various	1
misfortunes	1

now	1
swallowed	1
double	1
my	1
usual	1
quantity	1
and	1
soon	1
slept	1
profoundly	1

sleep	1

not	1
afford	1
me	1

misery	1

the	1

came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
we	1
landed	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
paris	1
i	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
overtaxed	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
repose	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
continue	1
my	1
journey	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
care	1
and	1
attentions	1
were	1
indefatigable	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
my	1
sufferings	1
and	1
sought	1
erroneous	1
methods	1
to	1
remedy	1
the	1
incurable	1
ill	1
he	1
wished	1
me	1
to	1
seek	1
amusement	1
in	1

i	1
abhorred	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
man	1
oh	1
not	1
abhorred	1
they	1
were	1
my	1
brethren	1
my	1
fellow	1
beings	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
attracted	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
repulsive	1
among	1
them	1
as	1
to	1
creatures	1
of	1
an	1
angelic	1
nature	1
and	1
celestial	1
mechanism	1
but	1
i	1
felt	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
share	1
their	1
intercourse	1
i	1
had	1
unchained	1
an	1
enemy	1
among	1
them	1
whose	1
joy	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
shed	1
their	1
blood	1
and	1
to	1
revel	1
in	1
their	1
groans	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
abhor	1
me	1
and	1
hunt	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
did	1
they	1
know	1
my	1
unhallowed	1
acts	1
and	1
the	1
crimes	1
which	1
had	1
their	1

yielded	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
avoid	1
society	1
and	1
strove	1
by	1
various	1
arguments	1
to	1
banish	1
my	1
despair	1
sometimes	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
i	1
felt	1
deeply	1
the	1
degradation	1
of	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
answer	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
murder	1
and	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
pride	1
alas	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
i	1
how	1
little	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
me	1
human	1
beings	1
their	1
feelings	1
and	1
passions	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
degraded	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
wretch	1
as	1
i	1
felt	1
pride	1
justine	1
poor	1
unhappy	1
justine	1
was	1
as	1
innocent	1
as	1
i	1
and	1
she	1
suffered	1
the	1

charge	1
she	1
died	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
the	1

i	1
murdered	1

william	1

and	1
henry	1

all	1
died	1
by	1
my	1

my	1
father	1

often	1
during	1
my	1
imprisonment	1
heard	1
me	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
assertion	1
when	1
i	1
thus	1
accused	1
myself	1
he	1
sometimes	1
seemed	1
to	1
desire	1
an	1
explanation	1
and	1
at	1
others	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
delirium	1
and	1
that	1
during	1
my	1
illness	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
had	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
imagination	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
preserved	1
in	1
my	1
convalescence	1
i	1
avoided	1
explanation	1
and	1
maintained	1
a	1
continual	1
silence	1
concerning	1
the	1
wretch	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
persuasion	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
supposed	1
mad	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
would	1
forever	1
have	1
chained	1
my	1
tongue	1
but	1
besides	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
disclose	1
a	1
secret	1
which	1
would	1
fill	1
my	1
hearer	1
with	1
consternation	1
and	1
make	1
fear	1
and	1
unnatural	1
horror	1
the	1
inmates	1
of	1
his	1
breast	1
i	1
checked	1
therefore	1
my	1
impatient	1
thirst	1
for	1
sympathy	1
and	1
was	1
silent	1
when	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
have	1
confided	1
the	1
fatal	1
secret	1
yet	1
still	1
words	1
like	1
those	1
i	1
have	1
recorded	1
would	1
burst	1
uncontrollably	1
from	1
me	1
i	1
could	1
offer	1
no	1
explanation	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
their	1
truth	1
in	1
part	1
relieved	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
my	1
mysterious	1
woe	1
upon	1
this	1
occasion	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
unbounded	1
wonder	1
my	1
dearest	1
victor	1
what	1
infatuation	1
is	1
this	1
my	1
dear	1
son	1
i	1
entreat	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
assertion	1
again	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
mad	1
i	1
cried	1
energetically	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
who	1
have	1
viewed	1
my	1
operations	1
can	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
my	1
truth	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
assassin	1
of	1
those	1
most	1
innocent	1
victims	1
they	1
died	1
by	1
my	1
machinations	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
would	1
i	1
have	1
shed	1
my	1
own	1
blood	1
drop	1
by	1
drop	1
to	1
have	1
saved	1
their	1
lives	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
my	1
father	1
indeed	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
this	1
speech	1
convinced	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
my	1
ideas	1
were	1
deranged	1
and	1
he	1
instantly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
conversation	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
alter	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts	1
he	1
wished	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
obliterate	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
scenes	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
ireland	1
and	1
never	1
alluded	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
suffered	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
as	1
time	1
passed	1
away	1
i	1
became	1
more	1
calm	1
misery	1
had	1
her	1
dwelling	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
but	1
i	1
no	1
longer	1
talked	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
incoherent	1
manner	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
crimes	1
sufficient	1
for	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
utmost	1
self	1
violence	1
i	1
curbed	1
the	1
imperious	1
voice	1
of	1
wretchedness	1
which	1
sometimes	1
desired	1
to	1
declare	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
and	1
my	1
manners	1
were	1
calmer	1
and	1
more	1
composed	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
since	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
we	1
left	1
paris	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
switzerland	1
i	1
received	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
from	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
dear	1
friend	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
uncle	1
dated	1
at	1
paris	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
a	1
formidable	1
distance	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
my	1
poor	1
cousin	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
suffered	1
i	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
looking	1
even	1
more	1
ill	1
than	1
when	1
you	1
quitted	1
geneva	1
this	1
winter	1
has	1
been	1
passed	1
most	1
miserably	1
tortured	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
anxious	1
suspense	1
yet	1
i	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
countenance	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
your	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
totally	1
void	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
yet	1
i	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
now	1
exist	1
that	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
miserable	1
a	1
year	1
ago	1
even	1
perhaps	1
augmented	1
by	1
time	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
disturb	1
you	1
at	1
this	1
period	1
when	1
so	1
many	1
misfortunes	1
weigh	1
upon	1
you	1
but	1
a	1
conversation	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
with	1
my	1
uncle	1
previous	1
to	1
his	1
departure	1
renders	1
some	1
explanation	1
necessary	1
before	1
we	1
meet	1
explanation	1
you	1
may	1
possibly	1
say	1
what	1
can	1
elizabeth	1
have	1
to	1
explain	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
say	1
this	1
my	1
questions	1
are	1
answered	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
doubts	1
satisfied	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
distant	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
dread	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
explanation	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
probability	1
of	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
any	1
longer	1
postpone	1
writing	1
what	1
during	1
your	1
absence	1
i	1
have	1
often	1
wished	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
you	1
but	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
begin	1
you	1
well	1
know	1
victor	1
that	1
our	1
union	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
favourite	1
plan	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
ever	1
since	1
our	1
infancy	1
we	1
were	1
told	1
this	1
when	1
young	1
and	1
taught	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
event	1
that	1
would	1
certainly	1
take	1
place	1
we	1
were	1
affectionate	1
playfellows	1
during	1
childhood	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
dear	1
and	1
valued	1
friends	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
we	1
grew	1
older	1
but	1
as	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
often	1
entertain	1
a	1
lively	1
affection	1
towards	1
each	1
other	1
without	1
desiring	1
a	1
more	1
intimate	1
union	1
may	1
not	1
such	1
also	1
be	1
our	1
case	1
tell	1
me	1
dearest	1
victor	1
answer	1
me	1
i	1
conjure	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
mutual	1
happiness	1
with	1
simple	1
truth	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
love	1
another	1
you	1
have	1
travelled	1
you	1
have	1
spent	1
several	1
years	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
at	1
ingolstadt	1
and	1
i	1
confess	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
last	1
autumn	1
so	1
unhappy	1
flying	1
to	1
solitude	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
every	1
creature	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
supposing	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
regret	1
our	1
connection	1
and	1
believe	1
yourself	1
bound	1
in	1
honour	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
your	1
parents	1
although	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves	1
to	1
your	1
inclinations	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
false	1
reasoning	1
i	1
confess	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
friend	1
that	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
airy	1
dreams	1
of	1
futurity	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
constant	1
friend	1
and	1
companion	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
happiness	1
i	1
desire	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
when	1
i	1
declare	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
our	1
marriage	1
would	1
render	1
me	1
eternally	1
miserable	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
dictate	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
free	1
choice	1
even	1
now	1
i	1
weep	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
borne	1
down	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
cruellest	1
misfortunes	1
you	1
may	1
stifle	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
honour	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
and	1
happiness	1
which	1
would	1
alone	1
restore	1
you	1
to	1
yourself	1
i	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
disinterested	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
you	1
may	1
increase	1
your	1
miseries	1
tenfold	1
by	1
being	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
your	1
wishes	1
ah	1
victor	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
your	1
cousin	1
and	1
playmate	1
has	1
too	1
sincere	1
a	1
love	1
for	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
miserable	1
by	1
this	1
supposition	1
be	1
happy	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
obey	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
one	1
request	1
remain	1
satisfied	1
that	1
nothing	1
on	1
earth	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
interrupt	1
my	1
tranquillity	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
this	1
letter	1
disturb	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
answer	1
tomorrow	1
or	1
the	1
next	1

even	1
until	1
you	1
come	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
pain	1
my	1
uncle	1
will	1
send	1
me	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
health	1

this	1
letter	1
revived	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
before	1
forgotten	1
the	1
threat	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
i	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
such	1
was	1
my	1
sentence	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
would	1
the	1
daemon	1
employ	1
every	1
art	1
to	1
destroy	1
me	1
and	1
tear	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
glimpse	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
promised	1
partly	1
to	1
console	1
my	1
sufferings	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
consummate	1
his	1
crimes	1
by	1
my	1
death	1
well	1
be	1
it	1
so	1
a	1
deadly	1
struggle	1
would	1
then	1
assuredly	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
which	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
victorious	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
and	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
me	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
vanquished	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
free	1
man	1
alas	1
what	1
freedom	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
peasant	1
enjoys	1
when	1
his	1
family	1
have	1
been	1
massacred	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
his	1
cottage	1
burnt	1
his	1
lands	1
laid	1
waste	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
turned	1
adrift	1
homeless	1
penniless	1
and	1
alone	1
but	1
free	1
such	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
liberty	1
except	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
possessed	1
a	1
treasure	1
alas	1
balanced	1
by	1
those	1
horrors	1
of	1
remorse	1
and	1
guilt	1
which	1
would	1
pursue	1
me	1
until	1
death	1
sweet	1
and	1
beloved	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
read	1
and	1
reread	1
her	1
letter	1
and	1
some	1
softened	1
feelings	1
stole	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
dared	1
to	1
whisper	1
paradisiacal	1
dreams	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
joy	1
but	1
the	1
apple	1
was	1
already	1
eaten	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
s	1
arm	1
bared	1
to	1
drive	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
hope	1
yet	1
i	1
would	1
die	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
happy	1
if	1
the	1
monster	1
executed	1
his	1
threat	1
death	1
was	1
inevitable	1
yet	1
again	1
i	1
considered	1
whether	1
my	1
marriage	1
would	1
hasten	1
my	1
fate	1
my	1
destruction	1
might	1
indeed	1
arrive	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
sooner	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
torturer	1
should	1
suspect	1
that	1
i	1
postponed	1
it	1
influenced	1
by	1
his	1
menaces	1
he	1
would	1
surely	1
find	1
other	1
and	1
perhaps	1
more	1
dreadful	1
means	1
of	1
revenge	1
he	1
had	1
vowed	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
wedding	1
night	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
threat	1
as	1
binding	1
him	1
to	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
for	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
satiated	1
with	1
blood	1
he	1
had	1
murdered	1
clerval	1
immediately	1
after	1
the	1
enunciation	1
of	1
his	1
threats	1
i	1
resolved	1
therefore	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
immediate	1
union	1
with	1
my	1
cousin	1
would	1
conduce	1
either	1
to	1
hers	1
or	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
happiness	1
my	1
adversary	1
s	1
designs	1
against	1
my	1
life	1
should	1
not	1
retard	1
it	1
a	1
single	1
hour	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
i	1
wrote	1
to	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
letter	1
was	1
calm	1
and	1
affectionate	1
i	1
fear	1
my	1
beloved	1
girl	1
i	1
said	1
little	1
happiness	1
remains	1
for	1
us	1
on	1
earth	1
yet	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
one	1
day	1
enjoy	1
is	1
centred	1
in	1
you	1
chase	1
away	1
your	1
idle	1
fears	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
do	1
i	1
consecrate	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
my	1
endeavours	1
for	1
contentment	1
i	1
have	1
one	1
secret	1
elizabeth	1
a	1
dreadful	1
one	1
when	1
revealed	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
chill	1
your	1
frame	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
then	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
surprised	1
at	1
my	1
misery	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
wonder	1
that	1
i	1
survive	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
endured	1
i	1
will	1
confide	1
this	1
tale	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
terror	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
our	1
marriage	1
shall	1
take	1
place	1
for	1
my	1
sweet	1
cousin	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
perfect	1
confidence	1
between	1
us	1
but	1
until	1
then	1
i	1
conjure	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
mention	1
or	1
allude	1
to	1
it	1
this	1
i	1
most	1
earnestly	1
entreat	1
and	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
comply	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
letter	1
we	1
returned	1
to	1
geneva	1
the	1
sweet	1
girl	1
welcomed	1
me	1
with	1
warm	1
affection	1
yet	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
beheld	1
my	1
emaciated	1
frame	1
and	1
feverish	1
cheeks	1
i	1
saw	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
also	1
she	1
was	1
thinner	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
heavenly	1
vivacity	1
that	1
had	1
before	1
charmed	1
me	1
but	1
her	1
gentleness	1
and	1
soft	1
looks	1
of	1
compassion	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
more	1
fit	1
companion	1
for	1
one	1
blasted	1
and	1
miserable	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
which	1
i	1
now	1
enjoyed	1
did	1
not	1
endure	1
memory	1
brought	1
madness	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
real	1
insanity	1
possessed	1
me	1
sometimes	1
i	1
was	1
furious	1
and	1
burnt	1
with	1
rage	1
sometimes	1
low	1
and	1
despondent	1
i	1
neither	1
spoke	1
nor	1
looked	1
at	1
anyone	1
but	1
sat	1
motionless	1
bewildered	1
by	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
miseries	1
that	1
overcame	1
me	1
elizabeth	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
draw	1
me	1
from	1
these	1
fits	1
her	1
gentle	1
voice	1
would	1
soothe	1
me	1
when	1
transported	1
by	1
passion	1
and	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
human	1
feelings	1
when	1
sunk	1
in	1
torpor	1
she	1
wept	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
when	1
reason	1
returned	1
she	1
would	1
remonstrate	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
inspire	1
me	1
with	1
resignation	1
ah	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
to	1
be	1
resigned	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
guilty	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace	1
the	1
agonies	1
of	1
remorse	1
poison	1
the	1
luxury	1
there	1
is	1
otherwise	1
sometimes	1
found	1
in	1
indulging	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
grief	1
soon	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
my	1
father	1
spoke	1
of	1
my	1
immediate	1
marriage	1
with	1
elizabeth	1
i	1
remained	1
silent	1
have	1
you	1
then	1
some	1
other	1
attachment	1
none	1
on	1
earth	1
i	1
love	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
with	1
delight	1
let	1
the	1
day	1
therefore	1
be	1
fixed	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
i	1
will	1
consecrate	1
myself	1
in	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
my	1
cousin	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
thus	1
heavy	1
misfortunes	1
have	1
befallen	1
us	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
only	1
cling	1
closer	1
to	1
what	1
remains	1
and	1
transfer	1
our	1
love	1
for	1
those	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
lost	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
yet	1
live	1
our	1
circle	1
will	1
be	1
small	1
but	1
bound	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
mutual	1
misfortune	1
and	1
when	1
time	1
shall	1
have	1
softened	1
your	1
despair	1
new	1
and	1
dear	1
objects	1
of	1
care	1
will	1
be	1
born	1
to	1
replace	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
cruelly	1
deprived	1
such	1
were	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
threat	1
returned	1
nor	1
can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
omnipotent	1
as	1
the	1
fiend	1
had	1
yet	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
deeds	1
of	1
blood	1
i	1
should	1
almost	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
invincible	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
pronounced	1
the	1
words	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
wedding	1
night	1
i	1
should	1
regard	1
the	1
threatened	1
fate	1
as	1
unavoidable	1
but	1
death	1
was	1
no	1
evil	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
were	1
balanced	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
therefore	1
with	1
a	1
contented	1
and	1
even	1
cheerful	1
countenance	1
agreed	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
cousin	1
would	1
consent	1
the	1
ceremony	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
ten	1
days	1
and	1
thus	1
put	1
as	1
i	1
imagined	1
the	1
seal	1
to	1
my	1
fate	1
great	1
god	1
if	1
for	1
one	1
instant	1
i	1
had	1
thought	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
hellish	1
intention	1
of	1
my	1
fiendish	1
adversary	1
i	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
banished	1
myself	1
forever	1
from	1
my	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
wandered	1
a	1
friendless	1
outcast	1
over	1
the	1
earth	1
than	1
have	1
consented	1
to	1
this	1
miserable	1
marriage	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
possessed	1
of	1
magic	1
powers	1
the	1
monster	1
had	1
blinded	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
real	1
intentions	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
prepared	1
only	1
my	1
own	1
death	1
i	1
hastened	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
dearer	1
victim	1
as	1
the	1
period	1
fixed	1
for	1
our	1
marriage	1
drew	1
nearer	1
whether	1
from	1
cowardice	1
or	1
a	1
prophetic	1
feeling	1
i	1
felt	1
my	1
heart	1
sink	1
within	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
concealed	1
my	1
feelings	1
by	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
hilarity	1
that	1
brought	1
smiles	1
and	1
joy	1
to	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
but	1
hardly	1
deceived	1
the	1
ever	1
watchful	1
and	1
nicer	1
eye	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
our	1
union	1
with	1
placid	1
contentment	1
not	1
unmingled	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
fear	1
which	1
past	1
misfortunes	1
had	1
impressed	1
that	1
what	1
now	1
appeared	1
certain	1
and	1
tangible	1
happiness	1
might	1
soon	1
dissipate	1
into	1
an	1
airy	1
dream	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
trace	1
but	1
deep	1
and	1
everlasting	1
regret	1
preparations	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
event	1
congratulatory	1
visits	1
were	1
received	1
and	1
all	1
wore	1
a	1
smiling	1
appearance	1
i	1
shut	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
i	1
could	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
the	1
anxiety	1
that	1
preyed	1
there	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
seeming	1
earnestness	1
into	1
the	1
plans	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
although	1
they	1
might	1
only	1
serve	1
as	1
the	1
decorations	1
of	1
my	1
tragedy	1
through	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
exertions	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
restored	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
austrian	1
government	1
a	1
small	1
possession	1
on	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
como	1
belonged	1
to	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
immediately	1
after	1
our	1
union	1
we	1
should	1
proceed	1
to	1
villa	1
lavenza	1
and	1
spend	1
our	1
first	1
days	1
of	1
happiness	1
beside	1
the	1
beautiful	1
lake	1
near	1
which	1
it	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
i	1
took	1
every	1
precaution	1
to	1
defend	1
my	1
person	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
fiend	1
should	1
openly	1
attack	1
me	1
i	1
carried	1
pistols	1
and	1
a	1
dagger	1
constantly	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
was	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
to	1
prevent	1
artifice	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
gained	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
indeed	1
as	1
the	1
period	1
approached	1
the	1
threat	1
appeared	1
more	1
as	1
a	1
delusion	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
worthy	1
to	1
disturb	1
my	1
peace	1
while	1
the	1
happiness	1
i	1
hoped	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
marriage	1
wore	1
a	1
greater	1
appearance	1
of	1
certainty	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
for	1
its	1
solemnization	1
drew	1
nearer	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
it	1
continually	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
an	1
occurrence	1
which	1
no	1
accident	1
could	1
possibly	1
prevent	1
elizabeth	1
seemed	1
happy	1
my	1
tranquil	1
demeanour	1
contributed	1
greatly	1
to	1
calm	1
her	1
mind	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
fulfil	1
my	1
wishes	1
and	1
my	1
destiny	1
she	1
was	1
melancholy	1
and	1
a	1
presentiment	1
of	1
evil	1
pervaded	1
her	1
and	1
perhaps	1
also	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
dreadful	1
secret	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
overjoyed	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bustle	1
of	1
preparation	1
only	1
recognized	1
in	1
the	1
melancholy	1
of	1
his	1
niece	1
the	1
diffidence	1
of	1
a	1
bride	1
after	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
performed	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
assembled	1
at	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
commence	1
our	1
journey	1
by	1
water	1
sleeping	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
evian	1
and	1
continuing	1
our	1
voyage	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
fair	1
the	1
wind	1
favourable	1
all	1
smiled	1
on	1
our	1
nuptial	1
embarkation	1
those	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
during	1
which	1
i	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
happiness	1
we	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
along	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
hot	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
sheltered	1
from	1
its	1
rays	1
by	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
canopy	1
while	1
we	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
sometimes	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
where	1
we	1
saw	1
mont	1
saleve	1
the	1
pleasant	1
banks	1
of	1
montalegre	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
surmounting	1
all	1
the	1
beautiful	1
mont	1
blanc	1
and	1
the	1
assemblage	1
of	1
snowy	1
mountains	1
that	1
in	1
vain	1
endeavour	1
to	1
emulate	1
her	1
sometimes	1
coasting	1
the	1
opposite	1
banks	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
mighty	1
jura	1
opposing	1
its	1
dark	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
ambition	1
that	1
would	1
quit	1
its	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
an	1
almost	1
insurmountable	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
invader	1
who	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
enslave	1
it	1
i	1
took	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
you	1
are	1
sorrowful	1
my	1
love	1
ah	1
if	1
you	1
knew	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
suffered	1
and	1
what	1
i	1
may	1
yet	1
endure	1
you	1
would	1
endeavour	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
taste	1
the	1
quiet	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
despair	1
that	1
this	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
least	1
permits	1
me	1
to	1
enjoy	1
be	1
happy	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
replied	1
elizabeth	1
there	1
is	1
i	1
hope	1
nothing	1
to	1
distress	1
you	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
lively	1
joy	1
is	1
not	1
painted	1
in	1
my	1
face	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
contented	1
something	1
whispers	1
to	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
depend	1
too	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
that	1
is	1
opened	1
before	1
us	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
sinister	1
voice	1
observe	1
how	1
fast	1
we	1
move	1
along	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
clouds	1
which	1
sometimes	1
obscure	1
and	1
sometimes	1
rise	1
above	1
the	1
dome	1
of	1
mont	1
blanc	1
render	1
this	1
scene	1
of	1
beauty	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
look	1
also	1
at	1
the	1
innumerable	1
fish	1
that	1
are	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
waters	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
distinguish	1
every	1
pebble	1
that	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
what	1
a	1
divine	1
day	1
how	1
happy	1
and	1
serene	1
all	1
nature	1
appears	1
thus	1
elizabeth	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
divert	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
mine	1
from	1
all	1
reflection	1
upon	1
melancholy	1
subjects	1
but	1
her	1
temper	1
was	1
fluctuating	1
joy	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
instants	1
shone	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
but	1
it	1
continually	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
distraction	1
and	1
reverie	1
the	1
sun	1
sank	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
we	1
passed	1
the	1
river	1
drance	1
and	1
observed	1
its	1
path	1
through	1
the	1
chasms	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
and	1
the	1
glens	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
hills	1
the	1
alps	1
here	1
come	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
lake	1
and	1
we	1
approached	1
the	1
amphitheatre	1
of	1
mountains	1
which	1
forms	1
its	1
eastern	1
boundary	1
the	1
spire	1
of	1
evian	1
shone	1
under	1
the	1
woods	1
that	1
surrounded	1
it	1

the	1
range	1

was	1
overhung	1

us	1
along	1

amazing	1
rapidity	1
sank	1
at	1
sunset	1
to	1
a	1
light	1
breeze	1
the	1
soft	1
air	1
just	1
ruffled	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
caused	1
a	1
pleasant	1
motion	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
as	1
we	1
approached	1
the	1
shore	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
wafted	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
hay	1
the	1
sun	1
sank	1
beneath	1
the	1
horizon	1
as	1
we	1
landed	1
and	1
as	1
i	1
touched	1
the	1
shore	1
i	1
felt	1
those	1
cares	1
and	1
fears	1
revive	1
which	1
soon	1
were	1
to	1
clasp	1
me	1
and	1
cling	1
to	1
me	1
forever	1

when	1
we	1
landed	1
we	1
walked	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
enjoying	1
the	1
transitory	1
light	1
and	1
then	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
and	1
contemplated	1
the	1
lovely	1
scene	1
of	1
waters	1
woods	1
and	1
mountains	1
obscured	1
in	1
darkness	1
yet	1
still	1
displaying	1
their	1
black	1
outlines	1
the	1
wind	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
now	1
rose	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
summit	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
clouds	1
swept	1
across	1
it	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
vulture	1
and	1
dimmed	1
her	1
rays	1
while	1
the	1
lake	1
reflected	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
busy	1
heavens	1
rendered	1
still	1
busier	1
by	1
the	1
restless	1
waves	1
that	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
rise	1
suddenly	1
a	1
heavy	1
storm	1
of	1
rain	1
descended	1
i	1
had	1
been	1
calm	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
but	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
night	1
obscured	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
objects	1
a	1
thousand	1
fears	1
arose	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
i	1
was	1
anxious	1
and	1
watchful	1
while	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
grasped	1
a	1
pistol	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
every	1
sound	1
terrified	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
resolved	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
sell	1
my	1
life	1
dearly	1
and	1
not	1
shrink	1
from	1
the	1
conflict	1
until	1
my	1
own	1
life	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
adversary	1
was	1
extinguished	1
elizabeth	1
observed	1
my	1
agitation	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
timid	1
and	1
fearful	1
silence	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
my	1
glance	1
which	1
communicated	1
terror	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
trembling	1
she	1
asked	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
agitates	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
victor	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
fear	1
oh	1
peace	1
peace	1
my	1
love	1
replied	1
i	1
this	1
night	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
but	1
this	1
night	1
is	1
dreadful	1
very	1
dreadful	1
i	1
passed	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
when	1
suddenly	1
i	1
reflected	1
how	1
fearful	1
the	1
combat	1
which	1
i	1
momentarily	1
expected	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
i	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
retire	1
resolving	1
not	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
until	1
i	1
had	1
obtained	1
some	1
knowledge	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
my	1
enemy	1
she	1
left	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
continued	1
some	1
time	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
inspecting	1
every	1
corner	1
that	1
might	1
afford	1
a	1
retreat	1
to	1
my	1
adversary	1
but	1
i	1
discovered	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
conjecture	1
that	1
some	1
fortunate	1
chance	1
had	1
intervened	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
menaces	1
when	1
suddenly	1
i	1
heard	1
a	1
shrill	1
and	1
dreadful	1
scream	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
into	1
which	1
elizabeth	1
had	1
retired	1
as	1
i	1
heard	1
it	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
rushed	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
my	1
arms	1
dropped	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
every	1
muscle	1
and	1
fibre	1
was	1
suspended	1
i	1
could	1
feel	1
the	1
blood	1
trickling	1
in	1
my	1
veins	1
and	1
tingling	1
in	1
the	1
extremities	1
of	1
my	1
limbs	1
this	1
state	1
lasted	1
but	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
scream	1
was	1
repeated	1
and	1
i	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
great	1
god	1
why	1
did	1
i	1
not	1
then	1
expire	1
why	1
am	1
i	1
here	1
to	1
relate	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
hope	1
and	1
the	1
purest	1
creature	1
on	1
earth	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
lifeless	1
and	1
inanimate	1
thrown	1
across	1
the	1
bed	1
her	1
head	1
hanging	1
down	1
and	1
her	1
pale	1
and	1
distorted	1
features	1
half	1
covered	1
by	1
her	1
hair	1
everywhere	1
i	1
turn	1
i	1
see	1
the	1
same	1
figure	1
her	1
bloodless	1
arms	1
and	1
relaxed	1
form	1
flung	1
by	1
the	1
murderer	1
on	1
its	1
bridal	1
bier	1
could	1
i	1
behold	1
this	1
and	1
live	1
alas	1
life	1
is	1
obstinate	1
and	1
clings	1
closest	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
hated	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
only	1
did	1
i	1
lose	1
recollection	1
i	1
fell	1
senseless	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
when	1
i	1
recovered	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
their	1
countenances	1
expressed	1
a	1
breathless	1
terror	1
but	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
others	1
appeared	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
mockery	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
that	1
oppressed	1
me	1
i	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
lay	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
elizabeth	1
my	1
love	1
my	1
wife	1
so	1
lately	1
living	1
so	1
dear	1
so	1
worthy	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
posture	1
in	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
first	1
beheld	1
her	1
and	1
now	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
her	1
head	1
upon	1
her	1
arm	1
and	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
thrown	1
across	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
neck	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
supposed	1
her	1
asleep	1
i	1
rushed	1
towards	1
her	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
with	1
ardour	1
but	1
the	1
deadly	1
languor	1
and	1
coldness	1
of	1
the	1
limbs	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
i	1
now	1
held	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
elizabeth	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
loved	1
and	1
cherished	1
the	1
murderous	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
s	1
grasp	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
issue	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
while	1
i	1
still	1
hung	1
over	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
despair	1
i	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
darkened	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
panic	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
pale	1
yellow	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
illuminate	1
the	1
chamber	1
the	1
shutters	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
back	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
horror	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
described	1
i	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
window	1
a	1
figure	1
the	1
most	1
hideous	1
and	1
abhorred	1
a	1
grin	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
jeer	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
fiendish	1
finger	1
he	1
pointed	1
towards	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
i	1
rushed	1
towards	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
drawing	1
a	1
pistol	1
from	1
my	1
bosom	1
fired	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
me	1
leaped	1
from	1
his	1
station	1
and	1
running	1
with	1
the	1
swiftness	1
of	1
lightning	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
pistol	1
brought	1
a	1
crowd	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
i	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
disappeared	1
and	1
we	1
followed	1
the	1
track	1
with	1
boats	1
nets	1
were	1
cast	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
after	1
passing	1
several	1
hours	1
we	1
returned	1
hopeless	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
companions	1
believing	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
form	1
conjured	1
up	1
by	1
my	1
fancy	1
after	1
having	1
landed	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
country	1
parties	1
going	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
among	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
vines	1
i	1
attempted	1
to	1
accompany	1
them	1
and	1
proceeded	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
my	1
head	1
whirled	1
round	1
my	1
steps	1
were	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
i	1
fell	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
utter	1
exhaustion	1
a	1
film	1
covered	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
my	1
skin	1
was	1
parched	1
with	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
fever	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
i	1
was	1
carried	1
back	1
and	1
placed	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
hardly	1
conscious	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
my	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
seek	1
something	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
lost	1
after	1
an	1
interval	1
i	1
arose	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
instinct	1
crawled	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
corpse	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
lay	1
there	1
were	1
women	1
weeping	1
around	1
i	1
hung	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
joined	1
my	1
sad	1
tears	1
to	1
theirs	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
no	1
distinct	1
idea	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
but	1
my	1
thoughts	1
rambled	1
to	1
various	1
subjects	1
reflecting	1
confusedly	1
on	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
their	1
cause	1
i	1
was	1
bewildered	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
horror	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
william	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
justine	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
clerval	1
and	1
lastly	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
my	1
only	1
remaining	1
friends	1
were	1
safe	1
from	1
the	1
malignity	1
of	1
the	1
fiend	1
my	1
father	1
even	1
now	1
might	1
be	1
writhing	1
under	1
his	1
grasp	1
and	1
ernest	1
might	1
be	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
this	1
idea	1
made	1
me	1
shudder	1
and	1
recalled	1
me	1
to	1
action	1
i	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
geneva	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
speed	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
procured	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
lake	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
unfavourable	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
fell	1
in	1
torrents	1
however	1
it	1
was	1
hardly	1
morning	1
and	1
i	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
by	1
night	1
i	1
hired	1
men	1
to	1
row	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
oar	1
myself	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
always	1
experienced	1
relief	1
from	1
mental	1
torment	1
in	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
but	1
the	1
overflowing	1
misery	1
i	1
now	1
felt	1
and	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
agitation	1
that	1
i	1
endured	1
rendered	1
me	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
exertion	1
i	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
oar	1
and	1
leaning	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
hands	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
every	1
gloomy	1
idea	1
that	1
arose	1
if	1
i	1
looked	1
up	1
i	1
saw	1
scenes	1
which	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
happier	1
time	1
and	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
contemplated	1
but	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
but	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
a	1
recollection	1
tears	1
streamed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
ceased	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
fish	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
been	1
observed	1
by	1
elizabeth	1
nothing	1
is	1
so	1
painful	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
sudden	1
change	1
the	1
sun	1
might	1
shine	1
or	1
the	1
clouds	1
might	1
lower	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
a	1
fiend	1
had	1
snatched	1
from	1
me	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
no	1
creature	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
so	1
miserable	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
so	1
frightful	1
an	1
event	1
is	1
single	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
man	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
i	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
incidents	1
that	1
followed	1
this	1
last	1
overwhelming	1
event	1
mine	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
horrors	1
i	1
have	1
reached	1
their	1
acme	1
and	1
what	1
i	1
must	1
now	1
relate	1
can	1
but	1
be	1
tedious	1
to	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
my	1
friends	1
were	1
snatched	1
away	1
i	1
was	1
left	1
desolate	1
my	1
own	1
strength	1
is	1
exhausted	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
tell	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
what	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
hideous	1
narration	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1
geneva	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
ernest	1
yet	1
lived	1
but	1
the	1
former	1
sunk	1
under	1
the	1
tidings	1
that	1
i	1
bore	1
i	1
see	1
him	1
now	1
excellent	1
and	1
venerable	1
old	1
man	1
his	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
in	1
vacancy	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
charm	1
and	1
their	1
delight	1
his	1
elizabeth	1
his	1
more	1
than	1
daughter	1
whom	1
he	1
doted	1
on	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
affection	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
feels	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
life	1
having	1
few	1
affections	1
clings	1
more	1
earnestly	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
remain	1
cursed	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
fiend	1
that	1
brought	1
misery	1
on	1
his	1
grey	1
hairs	1
and	1
doomed	1
him	1
to	1
waste	1
in	1
wretchedness	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
under	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
were	1
accumulated	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
existence	1
suddenly	1
gave	1
way	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
what	1
then	1
became	1
of	1
me	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
i	1
lost	1
sensation	1
and	1
chains	1
and	1
darkness	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
that	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
sometimes	1
indeed	1
i	1
dreamt	1
that	1
i	1
wandered	1
in	1
flowery	1
meadows	1
and	1
pleasant	1
vales	1
with	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
my	1
youth	1
but	1
i	1
awoke	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
dungeon	1
melancholy	1
followed	1
but	1
by	1
degrees	1
i	1
gained	1
a	1
clear	1
conception	1
of	1
my	1
miseries	1
and	1
situation	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
released	1
from	1
my	1
prison	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
me	1
mad	1
and	1
during	1
many	1
months	1
as	1
i	1
understood	1
a	1
solitary	1
cell	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
habitation	1
liberty	1
however	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
useless	1
gift	1
to	1
me	1
had	1
i	1
not	1
as	1
i	1
awakened	1
to	1
reason	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
awakened	1
to	1
revenge	1
as	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
past	1
misfortunes	1
pressed	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
their	1
cause	1
the	1
monster	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
created	1
the	1
miserable	1
daemon	1
whom	1
i	1
had	1
sent	1
abroad	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
my	1
destruction	1
i	1
was	1
possessed	1
by	1
a	1
maddening	1
rage	1
when	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
desired	1
and	1
ardently	1
prayed	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
him	1
within	1
my	1
grasp	1
to	1
wreak	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
signal	1
revenge	1
on	1
his	1
cursed	1
head	1
nor	1
did	1
my	1
hate	1
long	1
confine	1
itself	1
to	1
useless	1
wishes	1
i	1
began	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
means	1
of	1
securing	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
about	1
a	1
month	1
after	1
my	1
release	1
i	1
repaired	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
an	1
accusation	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
i	1
knew	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
required	1
him	1
to	1
exert	1
his	1
whole	1
authority	1
for	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
murderer	1
the	1
magistrate	1
listened	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
attention	1
and	1
kindness	1
be	1
assured	1
sir	1
said	1
he	1
no	1
pains	1
or	1
exertions	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
spared	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
villain	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
replied	1
i	1
listen	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
deposition	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
tale	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
fear	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
credit	1
it	1
were	1
there	1
not	1
something	1
in	1
truth	1
which	1
however	1
wonderful	1
forces	1
conviction	1
the	1
story	1
is	1
too	1
connected	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
no	1
motive	1
for	1
falsehood	1
my	1
manner	1
as	1
i	1
thus	1
addressed	1
him	1
was	1
impressive	1
but	1
calm	1
i	1
had	1
formed	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
heart	1
a	1
resolution	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
destroyer	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
this	1
purpose	1
quieted	1
my	1
agony	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
interval	1
reconciled	1
me	1
to	1
life	1
i	1
now	1
related	1
my	1
history	1
briefly	1
but	1
with	1
firmness	1
and	1
precision	1
marking	1
the	1
dates	1
with	1
accuracy	1
and	1
never	1
deviating	1
into	1
invective	1
or	1
exclamation	1
the	1
magistrate	1
appeared	1
at	1
first	1
perfectly	1
incredulous	1
but	1
as	1
i	1
continued	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
attentive	1
and	1
interested	1
i	1
saw	1
him	1
sometimes	1
shudder	1
with	1
horror	1
at	1
others	1
a	1
lively	1
surprise	1
unmingled	1
with	1
disbelief	1
was	1
painted	1
on	1
his	1
countenance	1
when	1
i	1
had	1
concluded	1
my	1
narration	1
i	1
said	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
being	1
whom	1
i	1
accuse	1
and	1
for	1
whose	1
seizure	1
and	1
punishment	1
i	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
to	1
exert	1
your	1
whole	1
power	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
magistrate	1
and	1
i	1
believe	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
your	1
feelings	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
revolt	1
from	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
those	1
functions	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
this	1
address	1
caused	1
a	1
considerable	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
physiognomy	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
auditor	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
my	1
story	1
with	1
that	1
half	1
kind	1
of	1
belief	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
tale	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
supernatural	1
events	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
act	1
officially	1
in	1
consequence	1
the	1
whole	1
tide	1
of	1
his	1
incredulity	1
returned	1
he	1
however	1
answered	1
mildly	1
i	1
would	1
willingly	1
afford	1
you	1
every	1
aid	1
in	1
your	1
pursuit	1
but	1
the	1
creature	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
speak	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
powers	1
which	1
would	1
put	1
all	1
my	1
exertions	1
to	1
defiance	1
who	1
can	1
follow	1
an	1
animal	1
which	1
can	1
traverse	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
ice	1
and	1
inhabit	1
caves	1
and	1
dens	1
where	1
no	1
man	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
intrude	1
besides	1
some	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
his	1
crimes	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
conjecture	1
to	1
what	1
place	1
he	1
has	1
wandered	1
or	1
what	1
region	1
he	1
may	1
now	1
inhabit	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
hovers	1
near	1
the	1
spot	1
which	1
i	1
inhabit	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
indeed	1
taken	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
alps	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
hunted	1
like	1
the	1
chamois	1
and	1
destroyed	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
of	1
prey	1
but	1
i	1
perceive	1
your	1
thoughts	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
credit	1
my	1
narrative	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
enemy	1
with	1
the	1
punishment	1
which	1
is	1
his	1
desert	1
as	1
i	1
spoke	1
rage	1
sparkled	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
the	1
magistrate	1
was	1
intimidated	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
will	1
exert	1
myself	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
monster	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
punishment	1
proportionate	1
to	1
his	1
crimes	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
yourself	1
described	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
properties	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
impracticable	1
and	1
thus	1
while	1
every	1
proper	1
measure	1
is	1
pursued	1
you	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
disappointment	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
say	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
avail	1
my	1
revenge	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
moment	1
to	1
you	1
yet	1
while	1
i	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
vice	1
i	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
devouring	1
and	1
only	1
passion	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
my	1
rage	1
is	1
unspeakable	1
when	1
i	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
murderer	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
turned	1
loose	1
upon	1
society	1
still	1
exists	1
you	1
refuse	1
my	1
just	1
demand	1
i	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
resource	1
and	1
i	1
devote	1
myself	1
either	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
to	1
his	1
destruction	1
i	1
trembled	1
with	1
excess	1
of	1
agitation	1
as	1
i	1
said	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
frenzy	1
in	1
my	1
manner	1
and	1
something	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
of	1
that	1
haughty	1
fierceness	1
which	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
old	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
possessed	1
but	1
to	1
a	1
genevan	1
magistrate	1
whose	1
mind	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
far	1
other	1
ideas	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
devotion	1
and	1
heroism	1
this	1
elevation	1
of	1
mind	1
had	1
much	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
madness	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
soothe	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
does	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
reverted	1
to	1
my	1
tale	1
as	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
delirium	1

cried	1
how	1

thy	1
pride	1
of	1
wisdom	1
cease	1
you	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
say	1
i	1
broke	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
angry	1
and	1
disturbed	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
meditate	1
on	1
some	1
other	1

alone	1

now	1
in	1

upon	1
the	1

prayed	1
for	1

revenge	1
kept	1
me	1
alive	1

dared	1
not	1
die	1
and	1
leave	1
my	1
adversary	1
in	1
being	1
when	1
i	1
quitted	1
geneva	1
my	1
first	1
labour	1
was	1
to	1
gain	1
some	1
clue	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
might	1
trace	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
my	1
fiendish	1
enemy	1
but	1
my	1
plan	1
was	1
unsettled	1
and	1
i	1
wandered	1
many	1
hours	1
round	1
the	1
confines	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
uncertain	1
what	1
path	1
i	1
should	1
pursue	1
as	1
night	1
approached	1
i	1
found	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
cemetery	1
where	1
william	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
reposed	1
i	1
entered	1
it	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
tomb	1
which	1
marked	1
their	1
graves	1
everything	1
was	1
silent	1
except	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
which	1
were	1
gently	1
agitated	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
nearly	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
scene	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
solemn	1
and	1
affecting	1
even	1
to	1
an	1
uninterested	1
observer	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
departed	1
seemed	1
to	1
flit	1
around	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
shadow	1
which	1
was	1
felt	1
but	1
not	1
seen	1
around	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
mourner	1
the	1
deep	1
grief	1
which	1
this	1
scene	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
excited	1
quickly	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
rage	1
and	1
despair	1
they	1
were	1
dead	1
and	1
i	1
lived	1
their	1
murderer	1
also	1
lived	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
him	1
i	1
must	1
drag	1
out	1
my	1
weary	1
existence	1
i	1
knelt	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
with	1
quivering	1
lips	1
exclaimed	1
by	1
the	1
sacred	1
earth	1
on	1
which	1
i	1
kneel	1
by	1
the	1
shades	1
that	1
wander	1
near	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
eternal	1
grief	1
that	1
i	1
feel	1
i	1
swear	1
and	1
by	1
thee	1
o	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
spirits	1
that	1
preside	1
over	1
thee	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
daemon	1
who	1
caused	1
this	1
misery	1
until	1
he	1
or	1
i	1
shall	1
perish	1
in	1
mortal	1
conflict	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
i	1
will	1
preserve	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
execute	1
this	1
dear	1
revenge	1
will	1
i	1
again	1
behold	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
tread	1
the	1
green	1
herbage	1
of	1
earth	1
which	1
otherwise	1
should	1
vanish	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
forever	1
and	1
i	1
call	1
on	1
you	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
on	1
you	1
wandering	1
ministers	1
of	1
vengeance	1
to	1
aid	1
and	1
conduct	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
work	1
let	1
the	1
cursed	1
and	1
hellish	1
monster	1
drink	1
deep	1
of	1
agony	1
let	1
him	1
feel	1
the	1
despair	1
that	1
now	1
torments	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
begun	1
my	1
adjuration	1
with	1
solemnity	1
and	1
an	1
awe	1
which	1
almost	1
assured	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
my	1
murdered	1
friends	1
heard	1
and	1
approved	1
my	1
devotion	1
but	1
the	1
furies	1
possessed	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
concluded	1
and	1
rage	1
choked	1
my	1
utterance	1
i	1
was	1
answered	1
through	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
fiendish	1
laugh	1
it	1
rang	1
on	1
my	1
ears	1
long	1
and	1
heavily	1
the	1
mountains	1
re	1
echoed	1
it	1
and	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
hell	1
surrounded	1
me	1
with	1
mockery	1
and	1
laughter	1
surely	1
in	1
that	1
moment	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
possessed	1
by	1
frenzy	1
and	1
have	1
destroyed	1
my	1
miserable	1
existence	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
vow	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
reserved	1
for	1
vengeance	1
the	1
laughter	1
died	1
away	1
when	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
and	1
abhorred	1
voice	1
apparently	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
an	1
audible	1
whisper	1
i	1
am	1
satisfied	1
miserable	1
wretch	1
you	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
i	1
am	1
satisfied	1
i	1
darted	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sound	1
proceeded	1
but	1
the	1
devil	1
eluded	1
my	1
grasp	1
suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
disk	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
arose	1
and	1
shone	1
full	1
upon	1
his	1
ghastly	1
and	1
distorted	1
shape	1
as	1
he	1
fled	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
mortal	1
speed	1
i	1
pursued	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
task	1
guided	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
clue	1
i	1
followed	1
the	1
windings	1
of	1
the	1
rhone	1
but	1
vainly	1
the	1
blue	1
mediterranean	1
appeared	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
chance	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
fiend	1
enter	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
vessel	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
black	1
sea	1
i	1
took	1
my	1
passage	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
ship	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
amidst	1
the	1
wilds	1
of	1
tartary	1
and	1
russia	1
although	1
he	1
still	1
evaded	1
me	1
i	1
have	1
ever	1
followed	1
in	1
his	1
track	1
sometimes	1
the	1
peasants	1
scared	1
by	1
this	1
horrid	1
apparition	1
informed	1
me	1
of	1
his	1
path	1
sometimes	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
i	1
lost	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
i	1
should	1
despair	1
and	1
die	1
left	1
some	1
mark	1
to	1
guide	1
me	1
the	1
snows	1
descended	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
his	1
huge	1
step	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
plain	1
to	1
you	1
first	1
entering	1
on	1
life	1
to	1
whom	1
care	1
is	1
new	1
and	1
agony	1
unknown	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
i	1
have	1
felt	1
and	1
still	1
feel	1
cold	1
want	1
and	1
fatigue	1
were	1
the	1
least	1
pains	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
endure	1
i	1
was	1
cursed	1
by	1
some	1
devil	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
me	1
my	1
eternal	1
hell	1
yet	1
still	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
good	1
followed	1
and	1
directed	1
my	1
steps	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
most	1
murmured	1
would	1
suddenly	1
extricate	1
me	1
from	1
seemingly	1
insurmountable	1
difficulties	1
sometimes	1
when	1
nature	1
overcome	1
by	1
hunger	1
sank	1
under	1
the	1
exhaustion	1
a	1
repast	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
that	1
restored	1
and	1
inspirited	1
me	1
the	1
fare	1
was	1
indeed	1
coarse	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
peasants	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
ate	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
spirits	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
invoked	1
to	1
aid	1
me	1
often	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
dry	1
the	1
heavens	1
cloudless	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
parched	1
by	1
thirst	1
a	1
slight	1
cloud	1
would	1
bedim	1
the	1
sky	1
shed	1
the	1
few	1
drops	1
that	1
revived	1
me	1
and	1
vanish	1
i	1
followed	1
when	1
i	1
could	1
the	1
courses	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
but	1
the	1
daemon	1
generally	1
avoided	1
these	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
chiefly	1
collected	1
in	1
other	1
places	1
human	1
beings	1
were	1
seldom	1
seen	1
and	1
i	1
generally	1
subsisted	1
on	1
the	1
wild	1
animals	1
that	1
crossed	1
my	1
path	1
i	1
had	1
money	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
gained	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
villagers	1
by	1
distributing	1
it	1
or	1
i	1
brought	1
with	1
me	1
some	1
food	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
killed	1
which	1
after	1
taking	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
i	1
always	1
presented	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
provided	1
me	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
utensils	1
for	1
cooking	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
thus	1
was	1
indeed	1
hateful	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
sleep	1
alone	1
that	1
i	1
could	1
taste	1
joy	1
o	1
blessed	1
sleep	1
often	1
when	1
most	1
miserable	1
i	1
sank	1
to	1
repose	1
and	1
my	1
dreams	1
lulled	1
me	1
even	1
to	1
rapture	1
the	1
spirits	1
that	1
guarded	1
me	1
had	1
provided	1
these	1
moments	1
or	1
rather	1
hours	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
retain	1
strength	1
to	1
fulfil	1
my	1
pilgrimage	1
deprived	1
of	1
this	1
respite	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
sunk	1
under	1
my	1
hardships	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
i	1
was	1
sustained	1
and	1
inspirited	1
by	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
night	1
for	1
in	1
sleep	1
i	1
saw	1
my	1
friends	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
my	1
beloved	1
country	1
again	1
i	1
saw	1
the	1
benevolent	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
heard	1
the	1
silver	1
tones	1
of	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
s	1
voice	1
and	1
beheld	1
clerval	1
enjoying	1
health	1
and	1
youth	1
often	1
when	1
wearied	1
by	1
a	1
toilsome	1
march	1
i	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
dreaming	1
until	1
night	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
then	1
enjoy	1
reality	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
my	1
dearest	1
friends	1
what	1
agonizing	1
fondness	1
did	1
i	1
feel	1
for	1
them	1
how	1
did	1
i	1
cling	1
to	1
their	1
dear	1
forms	1
as	1
sometimes	1
they	1
haunted	1
even	1
my	1
waking	1
hours	1
and	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
they	1
still	1
lived	1
at	1
such	1
moments	1
vengeance	1
that	1
burned	1
within	1
me	1
died	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
i	1
pursued	1
my	1
path	1
towards	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
more	1
as	1
a	1
task	1
enjoined	1
by	1
heaven	1
as	1
the	1
mechanical	1
impulse	1
of	1
some	1
power	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
unconscious	1
than	1
as	1
the	1
ardent	1
desire	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
what	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
whom	1
i	1
pursued	1
i	1
cannot	1
know	1
sometimes	1
indeed	1
he	1
left	1
marks	1
in	1
writing	1
on	1
the	1
barks	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
or	1
cut	1
in	1
stone	1
that	1
guided	1
me	1
and	1
instigated	1
my	1
fury	1
my	1
reign	1

not	1
yet	1
over	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
legible	1
in	1

of	1
these	1
inscriptions	1
you	1

and	1
my	1
power	1
is	1
complete	1

me	1
i	1
seek	1
the	1
everlasting	1
ices	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
cold	1
and	1
frost	1
to	1
which	1
i	1
am	1
impassive	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
near	1
this	1
place	1
if	1
you	1
follow	1
not	1
too	1
tardily	1
a	1
dead	1
hare	1

on	1
my	1
enemy	1
we	1
have	1
yet	1
to	1
wrestle	1
for	1
our	1
lives	1
but	1
many	1
hard	1
and	1
miserable	1
hours	1
must	1
you	1
endure	1
until	1
that	1
period	1
shall	1
arrive	1
scoffing	1
devil	1
again	1
do	1
i	1
vow	1
vengeance	1
again	1
do	1
i	1
devote	1
thee	1
miserable	1
fiend	1
to	1
torture	1
and	1
death	1
never	1
will	1
i	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
search	1
until	1
he	1
or	1
i	1
perish	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
what	1
ecstasy	1
shall	1
i	1
join	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
my	1
departed	1
friends	1
who	1
even	1
now	1
prepare	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
my	1
tedious	1
toil	1
and	1
horrible	1
pilgrimage	1
as	1
i	1
still	1
pursued	1
my	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
northward	1
the	1
snows	1
thickened	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
increased	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
almost	1
too	1
severe	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
peasants	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hovels	1
and	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
hardy	1
ventured	1
forth	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
animals	1
whom	1
starvation	1
had	1
forced	1
from	1
their	1
hiding	1
places	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
prey	1
the	1
rivers	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
ice	1
and	1
no	1
fish	1
could	1
be	1
procured	1
and	1
thus	1
i	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
my	1
chief	1
article	1
of	1
maintenance	1
the	1
triumph	1
of	1
my	1
enemy	1
increased	1
with	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
my	1
labours	1
one	1
inscription	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
prepare	1
your	1
toils	1
only	1
begin	1
wrap	1
yourself	1
in	1
furs	1
and	1
provide	1
food	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
enter	1
upon	1
a	1
journey	1
where	1
your	1
sufferings	1
will	1
satisfy	1
my	1
everlasting	1
hatred	1
my	1
courage	1
and	1
perseverance	1
were	1
invigorated	1
by	1
these	1
scoffing	1
words	1
i	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
fail	1
in	1
my	1
purpose	1
and	1
calling	1
on	1
heaven	1
to	1
support	1
me	1
i	1
continued	1
with	1
unabated	1
fervour	1
to	1
traverse	1
immense	1
deserts	1
until	1
the	1
ocean	1
appeared	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
formed	1
the	1
utmost	1
boundary	1
of	1
the	1
horizon	1
oh	1
how	1
unlike	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
blue	1
seasons	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
covered	1
with	1
ice	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
from	1
land	1
by	1
its	1
superior	1
wildness	1
and	1
ruggedness	1
the	1
greeks	1
wept	1
for	1
joy	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
from	1
the	1
hills	1
of	1
asia	1
and	1
hailed	1
with	1
rapture	1
the	1
boundary	1
of	1
their	1
toils	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
weep	1
but	1
i	1
knelt	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
heart	1
thanked	1
my	1
guiding	1
spirit	1
for	1
conducting	1
me	1
in	1
safety	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
i	1
hoped	1
notwithstanding	1
my	1
adversary	1
s	1
gibe	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
grapple	1
with	1
him	1
some	1
weeks	1
before	1
this	1
period	1
i	1
had	1
procured	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
dogs	1
and	1
thus	1
traversed	1
the	1
snows	1
with	1
inconceivable	1
speed	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
the	1
fiend	1
possessed	1
the	1
same	1
advantages	1
but	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
as	1
before	1
i	1
had	1
daily	1
lost	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
i	1
now	1
gained	1
on	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
saw	1
the	1
ocean	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
day	1
s	1
journey	1
in	1
advance	1
and	1
i	1
hoped	1
to	1
intercept	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
beach	1
with	1
new	1
courage	1
therefore	1
i	1
pressed	1
on	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
days	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
wretched	1
hamlet	1
on	1
the	1
seashore	1
i	1
inquired	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiend	1
and	1
gained	1
accurate	1
information	1
a	1
gigantic	1
monster	1
they	1
said	1
had	1
arrived	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
and	1
many	1
pistols	1
putting	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
a	1
solitary	1
cottage	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
terrific	1
appearance	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
off	1
their	1
store	1
of	1
winter	1
food	1
and	1
placing	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sledge	1
to	1
draw	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seized	1
on	1
a	1
numerous	1
drove	1
of	1
trained	1
dogs	1
he	1
had	1
harnessed	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
horror	1
struck	1
villagers	1
had	1
pursued	1
his	1
journey	1
across	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
direction	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
no	1
land	1
and	1
they	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
speedily	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
ice	1
or	1
frozen	1
by	1
the	1
eternal	1
frosts	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
information	1
i	1
suffered	1
a	1
temporary	1
access	1
of	1
despair	1
he	1
had	1
escaped	1
me	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
commence	1
a	1
destructive	1
and	1
almost	1
endless	1
journey	1
across	1
the	1
mountainous	1
ices	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
amidst	1
cold	1
that	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
could	1
long	1
endure	1
and	1
which	1
i	1
the	1
native	1
of	1
a	1
genial	1
and	1
sunny	1
climate	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
survive	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
fiend	1
should	1
live	1
and	1
be	1
triumphant	1
my	1
rage	1
and	1
vengeance	1
returned	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
tide	1
overwhelmed	1
every	1
other	1
feeling	1
after	1
a	1
slight	1
repose	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
hovered	1
round	1
and	1
instigated	1
me	1
to	1
toil	1
and	1
revenge	1
i	1
prepared	1
for	1
my	1
journey	1
i	1
exchanged	1
my	1
land	1
sledge	1
for	1
one	1
fashioned	1
for	1
the	1
inequalities	1
of	1
the	1
frozen	1
ocean	1
and	1
purchasing	1
a	1
plentiful	1
stock	1
of	1
provisions	1
i	1
departed	1
from	1
land	1
i	1
cannot	1
guess	1
how	1
many	1
days	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
then	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
endured	1
misery	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
eternal	1
sentiment	1
of	1
a	1
just	1
retribution	1
burning	1
within	1
my	1
heart	1
could	1
have	1
enabled	1
me	1
to	1
support	1
immense	1
and	1
rugged	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
often	1
barred	1
up	1
my	1
passage	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
heard	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
sea	1
which	1
threatened	1
my	1
destruction	1
but	1
again	1
the	1
frost	1
came	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
secure	1
by	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
provision	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
consumed	1
i	1
should	1
guess	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
passed	1
three	1
weeks	1
in	1
this	1
journey	1
and	1
the	1
continual	1
protraction	1
of	1
hope	1
returning	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
heart	1
often	1
wrung	1
bitter	1
drops	1
of	1
despondency	1
and	1
grief	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
despair	1
had	1
indeed	1
almost	1
secured	1
her	1
prey	1
and	1
i	1
should	1
soon	1
have	1
sunk	1
beneath	1
this	1
misery	1
once	1
after	1
the	1
poor	1
animals	1
that	1
conveyed	1
me	1
had	1
with	1
incredible	1
toil	1
gained	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
a	1
sloping	1
ice	1
mountain	1
and	1
one	1
sinking	1
under	1
his	1
fatigue	1
died	1
i	1
viewed	1
the	1
expanse	1
before	1
me	1
with	1
anguish	1
when	1
suddenly	1
my	1
eye	1
caught	1
a	1
dark	1
speck	1
upon	1
the	1
dusky	1
plain	1
i	1
strained	1
my	1
sight	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
wild	1
cry	1
of	1
ecstasy	1
when	1
i	1
distinguished	1
a	1
sledge	1
and	1
the	1
distorted	1
proportions	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
known	1
form	1
within	1
oh	1
with	1
what	1
a	1
burning	1
gush	1
did	1
hope	1
revisit	1
my	1
heart	1
warm	1
tears	1
filled	1
my	1
eyes	1
which	1
i	1
hastily	1
wiped	1
away	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
intercept	1
the	1
view	1
i	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
daemon	1
but	1
still	1
my	1
sight	1
was	1
dimmed	1
by	1
the	1
burning	1
drops	1
until	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
emotions	1
that	1
oppressed	1
me	1
i	1
wept	1
aloud	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
delay	1
i	1
disencumbered	1
the	1
dogs	1
of	1
their	1
dead	1
companion	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
plentiful	1
portion	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
hour	1
s	1
rest	1
which	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
and	1
yet	1
which	1
was	1
bitterly	1
irksome	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
continued	1
my	1
route	1
the	1
sledge	1
was	1
still	1
visible	1
nor	1
did	1
i	1
again	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
except	1
at	1
the	1
moments	1
when	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
some	1
ice	1
rock	1
concealed	1
it	1
with	1
its	1
intervening	1
crags	1
i	1
indeed	1
perceptibly	1
gained	1
on	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
after	1
nearly	1
two	1
days	1
journey	1
i	1
beheld	1
my	1
enemy	1
at	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
distant	1
my	1
heart	1
bounded	1
within	1
me	1
but	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
appeared	1
almost	1
within	1
grasp	1
of	1
my	1
foe	1
my	1
hopes	1
were	1
suddenly	1
extinguished	1
and	1
i	1
lost	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
utterly	1
than	1
i	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
before	1
a	1
ground	1
sea	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
thunder	1
of	1
its	1
progress	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
rolled	1
and	1
swelled	1
beneath	1
me	1
became	1
every	1
moment	1
more	1
ominous	1
and	1
terrific	1
i	1
pressed	1
on	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
the	1
wind	1
arose	1
the	1
sea	1
roared	1
and	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
mighty	1
shock	1
of	1
an	1
earthquake	1
it	1
split	1
and	1
cracked	1
with	1
a	1
tremendous	1
and	1
overwhelming	1
sound	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
soon	1
finished	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
sea	1
rolled	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
left	1
drifting	1
on	1
a	1
scattered	1
piece	1
of	1
ice	1
that	1
was	1
continually	1
lessening	1
and	1
thus	1
preparing	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
hideous	1
death	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
many	1
appalling	1
hours	1
passed	1
several	1
of	1
my	1
dogs	1
died	1
and	1
i	1
myself	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sink	1
under	1
the	1
accumulation	1
of	1
distress	1
when	1
i	1
saw	1
your	1
vessel	1
riding	1
at	1
anchor	1
and	1
holding	1
forth	1
to	1
me	1
hopes	1
of	1
succour	1
and	1
life	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
conception	1
that	1
vessels	1
ever	1
came	1
so	1
far	1
north	1
and	1
was	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
i	1
quickly	1
destroyed	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
sledge	1
to	1
construct	1
oars	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
was	1
enabled	1
with	1
infinite	1
fatigue	1
to	1
move	1
my	1
ice	1
raft	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
your	1
ship	1
i	1
had	1
determined	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
southwards	1
still	1
to	1
trust	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
rather	1
than	1
abandon	1
my	1
purpose	1
i	1
hoped	1
to	1
induce	1
you	1
to	1
grant	1
me	1
a	1
boat	1
with	1
which	1
i	1
could	1
pursue	1
my	1
enemy	1
but	1
your	1
direction	1

this	1

story	1
margaret	1

do	1
you	1
not	1
feel	1
your	1
blood	1
congeal	1
with	1
horror	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
even	1
now	1
curdles	1
mine	1
sometimes	1
seized	1
with	1
sudden	1
agony	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
continue	1
his	1
tale	1
at	1
others	1
his	1
voice	1
broken	1
yet	1
piercing	1
uttered	1
with	1
difficulty	1
the	1
words	1
so	1
replete	1
with	1
anguish	1
his	1
fine	1

eyes	1
were	1
now	1
lighted	1
up	1
with	1
indignation	1
now	1
subdued	1
to	1
downcast	1
sorrow	1
and	1
quenched	1
in	1
infinite	1
wretchedness	1
sometimes	1
he	1
commanded	1
his	1
countenance	1
and	1
tones	1
and	1
related	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
incidents	1
with	1
a	1
tranquil	1
voice	1
suppressing	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
agitation	1
then	1
like	1
a	1
volcano	1
bursting	1
forth	1
his	1
face	1
would	1
suddenly	1
change	1
to	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
wildest	1
rage	1
as	1
he	1
shrieked	1
out	1
imprecations	1
on	1
his	1

his	1
tale	1
is	1
connected	1
and	1
told	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1

i	1
own	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
felix	1

which	1
he	1
showed	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
apparition	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
seen	1
from	1
our	1
ship	1
brought	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
greater	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
narrative	1
than	1
his	1
asseverations	1
however	1
earnest	1
and	1
connected	1
such	1
a	1
monster	1
has	1
then	1
really	1
existence	1
i	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
it	1
yet	1
i	1
am	1
lost	1
in	1
surprise	1
and	1
admiration	1
sometimes	1
i	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
gain	1
from	1
frankenstein	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
his	1
creature	1
s	1
formation	1

on	1

he	1
was	1

discovered	1
that	1
i	1
made	1
notes	1
concerning	1
his	1
history	1
he	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
corrected	1
and	1
augmented	1
them	1
in	1
many	1
places	1
but	1
principally	1
in	1
giving	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
spirit	1
to	1
the	1
conversations	1
he	1
held	1
with	1
his	1
enemy	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
preserved	1
my	1
narration	1

i	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
mutilated	1
one	1
should	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
posterity	1
thus	1
has	1
a	1
week	1
passed	1
away	1
while	1
i	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
strangest	1
tale	1
that	1
ever	1
imagination	1
formed	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
have	1
been	1
drunk	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
interest	1
for	1
my	1
guest	1
which	1
this	1
tale	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
elevated	1
and	1
gentle	1
manners	1
have	1
created	1
i	1
wish	1
to	1
soothe	1
him	1
yet	1
can	1
i	1
counsel	1
one	1
so	1
infinitely	1
miserable	1
so	1
destitute	1
of	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
consolation	1
to	1
live	1
oh	1
no	1
the	1
only	1
joy	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
now	1
know	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
he	1
composes	1
his	1
shattered	1
spirit	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
death	1
yet	1
he	1
enjoys	1
one	1
comfort	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
solitude	1
and	1
delirium	1
he	1
believes	1
that	1
when	1
in	1
dreams	1
he	1
holds	1
converse	1
with	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
derives	1
from	1
that	1
communion	1
consolation	1
for	1
his	1
miseries	1
or	1
excitements	1
to	1
his	1
vengeance	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
creations	1
of	1
his	1
fancy	1
but	1
the	1
beings	1
themselves	1
who	1
visit	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
a	1
remote	1
world	1
this	1
faith	1
gives	1
a	1
solemnity	1
to	1
his	1
reveries	1
that	1
render	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
almost	1
as	1
imposing	1
and	1
interesting	1
as	1
truth	1
our	1
conversations	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
history	1
and	1
misfortunes	1
on	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
general	1
literature	1
he	1
displays	1
unbounded	1
knowledge	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
and	1
piercing	1
apprehension	1
his	1
eloquence	1
is	1
forcible	1
and	1
touching	1
nor	1
can	1
i	1
hear	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
relates	1
a	1
pathetic	1
incident	1
or	1
endeavours	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
pity	1
or	1
love	1
without	1
tears	1
what	1
a	1
glorious	1
creature	1
must	1
he	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
prosperity	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
thus	1
noble	1
and	1
godlike	1
in	1
ruin	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
feel	1
his	1
own	1
worth	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
fall	1
when	1
younger	1
said	1
he	1
i	1
believed	1
myself	1
destined	1
for	1
some	1
great	1
enterprise	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
profound	1
but	1
i	1
possessed	1
a	1
coolness	1
of	1
judgment	1
that	1
fitted	1
me	1
for	1
illustrious	1
achievements	1
this	1
sentiment	1
of	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
my	1
nature	1
supported	1
me	1
when	1
others	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
oppressed	1
for	1
i	1
deemed	1
it	1
criminal	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
in	1
useless	1
grief	1
those	1
talents	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1
creatures	1
when	1
i	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
i	1
had	1
completed	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
one	1
than	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
sensitive	1
and	1
rational	1
animal	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
rank	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
common	1
projectors	1
but	1
this	1
thought	1
which	1
supported	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
my	1
career	1
now	1
serves	1
only	1
to	1
plunge	1
me	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
all	1
my	1
speculations	1
and	1
hopes	1
are	1
as	1
nothing	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
archangel	1
who	1
aspired	1
to	1
omnipotence	1
i	1
am	1
chained	1
in	1
an	1
eternal	1
hell	1
my	1
imagination	1
was	1
vivid	1
yet	1
my	1
powers	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
application	1
were	1
intense	1
by	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
these	1
qualities	1
i	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
executed	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
even	1
now	1
i	1
cannot	1
recollect	1
without	1
passion	1
my	1
reveries	1
while	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
incomplete	1
i	1
trod	1
heaven	1
in	1
my	1
thoughts	1
now	1
exulting	1
in	1
my	1
powers	1
now	1
burning	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
effects	1
from	1
my	1
infancy	1
i	1
was	1
imbued	1
with	1
high	1
hopes	1
and	1
a	1
lofty	1
ambition	1
but	1
how	1
am	1
i	1
sunk	1
oh	1
my	1
friend	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
known	1
me	1
as	1
i	1
once	1
was	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
recognize	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
degradation	1
despondency	1
rarely	1
visited	1
my	1
heart	1
a	1
high	1
destiny	1
seemed	1
to	1
bear	1
me	1
on	1
until	1
i	1
fell	1
never	1
never	1
again	1
to	1
rise	1
must	1
i	1
then	1
lose	1
this	1
admirable	1
being	1
i	1
have	1
longed	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
i	1
have	1
sought	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
sympathize	1
with	1
and	1
love	1
me	1
behold	1
on	1
these	1
desert	1
seas	1
i	1
have	1
found	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
but	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
have	1
gained	1
him	1
only	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
value	1
and	1
lose	1
him	1
i	1
would	1
reconcile	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
but	1
he	1
repulses	1
the	1
idea	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
walton	1
he	1
said	1
for	1
your	1
kind	1
intentions	1
towards	1
so	1
miserable	1
a	1
wretch	1
but	1
when	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
new	1
ties	1
and	1
fresh	1
affections	1
think	1
you	1
that	1
any	1
can	1
replace	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
gone	1
can	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
clerval	1
was	1
or	1
any	1
woman	1
another	1
elizabeth	1
even	1
where	1
the	1
affections	1
are	1
not	1
strongly	1
moved	1
by	1
any	1
superior	1
excellence	1
the	1
companions	1
of	1
our	1
childhood	1
always	1
possess	1
a	1
certain	1
power	1
over	1
our	1
minds	1
which	1
hardly	1
any	1
later	1
friend	1
can	1
obtain	1
they	1
know	1
our	1
infantine	1
dispositions	1
which	1
however	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
afterwards	1
modified	1
are	1
never	1
eradicated	1
and	1
they	1
can	1
judge	1
of	1
our	1
actions	1
with	1
more	1
certain	1
conclusions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
our	1
motives	1
a	1
sister	1
or	1
a	1
brother	1
can	1
never	1
unless	1
indeed	1
such	1
symptoms	1
have	1
been	1
shown	1
early	1
suspect	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
fraud	1
or	1
false	1
dealing	1
when	1
another	1
friend	1
however	1
strongly	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
attached	1
may	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
be	1
contemplated	1
with	1
suspicion	1
but	1
i	1
enjoyed	1
friends	1
dear	1
not	1
only	1
through	1
habit	1
and	1
association	1
but	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
merits	1
and	1
wherever	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
soothing	1
voice	1
of	1
my	1
elizabeth	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
clerval	1
will	1
be	1
ever	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear	1
they	1
are	1
dead	1
and	1
but	1
one	1
feeling	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
solitude	1
can	1
persuade	1
me	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
life	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
any	1
high	1
undertaking	1
or	1
design	1
fraught	1
with	1
extensive	1
utility	1
to	1
my	1
fellow	1

then	1
could	1
i	1
live	1
to	1
fulfil	1
it	1
but	1
such	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
destiny	1
i	1
must	1
pursue	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
being	1
to	1
whom	1
i	1
gave	1
existence	1
then	1
my	1
lot	1

you	1

again	1
dear	1
england	1

the	1

mountains	1

of	1
no	1

i	1

i	1

none	1

something	1
terribly	1
appalling	1
in	1
our	1

yet	1
my	1
courage	1
and	1
hopes	1
do	1
not	1
desert	1
me	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
all	1
these	1

endangered	1
through	1
me	1
if	1

be	1
the	1

of	1
your	1

you	1
will	1
not	1

my	1
destruction	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
anxiously	1
await	1
my	1
return	1
years	1
will	1
pass	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
visitings	1
of	1
despair	1

yet	1
be	1
tortured	1
by	1
hope	1
oh	1
my	1
beloved	1
sister	1
the	1
sickening	1
failing	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1

is	1
in	1

more	1

my	1

you	1

you	1

and	1
talks	1
as	1
if	1
life	1
were	1
a	1
possession	1
which	1
he	1
valued	1
he	1
reminds	1
me	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
same	1
accidents	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
other	1
navigators	1
who	1
have	1
attempted	1
this	1

me	1
with	1
cheerful	1
auguries	1
even	1
the	1
sailors	1
feel	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
eloquence	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1

no	1
longer	1

rouses	1
their	1
energies	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
they	1
believe	1
these	1
vast	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
are	1
mole	1
hills	1
which	1
will	1
vanish	1
before	1

september	1
5th	1
a	1
scene	1
has	1
just	1
passed	1
of	1
such	1
uncommon	1
interest	1
that	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
these	1
papers	1
may	1
never	1
reach	1
you	1
yet	1
i	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
recording	1
it	1
we	1
are	1
still	1
surrounded	1
by	1
mountains	1
of	1
ice	1
still	1
in	1
imminent	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
crushed	1
in	1
their	1
conflict	1
the	1
cold	1
is	1
excessive	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
comrades	1
have	1
already	1
found	1
a	1
grave	1
amidst	1
this	1
scene	1
of	1
desolation	1
frankenstein	1
has	1
daily	1
declined	1
in	1
health	1
a	1
feverish	1
fire	1
still	1
glimmers	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
exhausted	1
and	1
when	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
to	1
any	1
exertion	1
he	1
speedily	1
sinks	1
again	1
into	1
apparent	1
lifelessness	1
i	1
mentioned	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
the	1
fears	1
i	1
entertained	1
of	1
a	1
mutiny	1
this	1
morning	1
as	1
i	1
sat	1
watching	1
the	1
wan	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
his	1
eyes	1
half	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
limbs	1
hanging	1
listlessly	1
i	1
was	1
roused	1
by	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
who	1
demanded	1
admission	1
into	1
the	1
cabin	1
they	1
entered	1
and	1
their	1
leader	1
addressed	1
me	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
sailors	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
deputation	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
requisition	1
which	1
in	1
justice	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
we	1
were	1
immured	1
in	1
ice	1
and	1
should	1
probably	1
never	1
escape	1
but	1
they	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
as	1
was	1
possible	1
the	1
ice	1
should	1
dissipate	1
and	1
a	1
free	1
passage	1
be	1
opened	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
rash	1
enough	1
to	1
continue	1
my	1
voyage	1
and	1
lead	1
them	1
into	1
fresh	1
dangers	1
after	1
they	1
might	1
happily	1
have	1
surmounted	1
this	1
they	1
insisted	1
therefore	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
engage	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
promise	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
vessel	1
should	1
be	1
freed	1
i	1
would	1
instantly	1
direct	1
my	1
course	1
southwards	1
this	1
speech	1
troubled	1
me	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
despaired	1
nor	1
had	1
i	1
yet	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
returning	1
if	1
set	1
free	1
yet	1
could	1
i	1
in	1
justice	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
possibility	1
refuse	1
this	1
demand	1
i	1
hesitated	1
before	1
i	1
answered	1
when	1
frankenstein	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
silent	1
and	1
indeed	1
appeared	1
hardly	1
to	1
have	1
force	1
enough	1
to	1
attend	1
now	1
roused	1
himself	1
his	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
flushed	1
with	1
momentary	1
vigour	1
turning	1
towards	1
the	1
men	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
demand	1
of	1
your	1
captain	1
are	1
you	1
then	1
so	1
easily	1
turned	1
from	1
your	1
design	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
call	1
this	1
a	1
glorious	1
expedition	1
and	1
wherefore	1
was	1
it	1
glorious	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
smooth	1
and	1
placid	1
as	1
a	1
southern	1
sea	1
but	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
dangers	1
and	1
terror	1
because	1
at	1
every	1
new	1
incident	1
your	1
fortitude	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
forth	1
and	1
your	1
courage	1
exhibited	1
because	1
danger	1
and	1
death	1
surrounded	1
it	1
and	1
these	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
brave	1
and	1
overcome	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
glorious	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
it	1
an	1
honourable	1
undertaking	1
you	1
were	1
hereafter	1
to	1
be	1
hailed	1
as	1
the	1
benefactors	1
of	1
your	1
species	1
your	1
names	1
adored	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
brave	1
men	1
who	1
encountered	1
death	1
for	1
honour	1
and	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
mankind	1
and	1
now	1
behold	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
imagination	1
of	1
danger	1
or	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
the	1
first	1
mighty	1
and	1
terrific	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
courage	1
you	1
shrink	1
away	1
and	1
are	1
content	1
to	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
as	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
strength	1
enough	1
to	1
endure	1
cold	1
and	1
peril	1
and	1
so	1
poor	1
souls	1
they	1
were	1
chilly	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
warm	1
firesides	1
why	1
that	1
requires	1
not	1
this	1
preparation	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
thus	1
far	1
and	1
dragged	1
your	1
captain	1
to	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
a	1
defeat	1
merely	1
to	1
prove	1
yourselves	1
cowards	1
oh	1
be	1
men	1
or	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
men	1
be	1
steady	1
to	1
your	1
purposes	1
and	1
firm	1
as	1
a	1
rock	1
this	1
ice	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
such	1
stuff	1
as	1
your	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
it	1
is	1
mutable	1
and	1
cannot	1
withstand	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
families	1
with	1
the	1
stigma	1
of	1
disgrace	1
marked	1
on	1
your	1
brows	1
return	1
as	1
heroes	1
who	1
have	1
fought	1
and	1
conquered	1
and	1
who	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
on	1
the	1
foe	1
he	1
spoke	1
this	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
modulated	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
feelings	1
expressed	1
in	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
lofty	1
design	1
and	1
heroism	1
that	1
can	1
you	1
wonder	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
moved	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
reply	1
i	1
spoke	1
i	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
retire	1
and	1
consider	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
lead	1
them	1
farther	1
north	1
if	1
they	1
strenuously	1
desired	1
the	1
contrary	1
but	1
that	1
i	1
hoped	1
that	1
with	1
reflection	1
their	1
courage	1
would	1
return	1
they	1
retired	1
and	1
i	1
turned	1
towards	1
my	1
friend	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
sunk	1
in	1
languor	1
and	1
almost	1
deprived	1
of	1
life	1
how	1
all	1
this	1
will	1
terminate	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
but	1
i	1
had	1
rather	1
die	1
than	1
return	1
shamefully	1
my	1
purpose	1
unfulfilled	1
yet	1
i	1
fear	1
such	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
fate	1
the	1
men	1
unsupported	1
by	1
ideas	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
can	1
never	1
willingly	1
continue	1
to	1
endure	1
their	1
present	1
hardships	1
september	1
7th	1
the	1
die	1
is	1
cast	1
i	1
have	1
consented	1
to	1
return	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
destroyed	1
thus	1
are	1
my	1
hopes	1
blasted	1
by	1
cowardice	1
and	1
indecision	1
i	1
come	1
back	1
ignorant	1
and	1
disappointed	1
it	1
requires	1
more	1
philosophy	1
than	1
i	1
possess	1
to	1
bear	1
this	1
injustice	1
with	1
patience	1
september	1
12th	1
it	1
is	1
past	1
i	1
am	1
returning	1
to	1
england	1
i	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
hopes	1
of	1
utility	1
and	1
glory	1
i	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
friend	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
detail	1
these	1
bitter	1
circumstances	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
sister	1
and	1
while	1
i	1
am	1
wafted	1
towards	1
england	1
and	1
towards	1
you	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
despond	1
september	1
9th	1
the	1
ice	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
and	1
roarings	1
like	1
thunder	1
were	1
heard	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
as	1
the	1
islands	1
split	1
and	1
cracked	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
imminent	1
peril	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
remain	1
passive	1
my	1
chief	1
attention	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
guest	1
whose	1
illness	1
increased	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
the	1
ice	1
cracked	1
behind	1
us	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
with	1
force	1
towards	1
the	1
north	1
a	1
breeze	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
11th	1
the	1
passage	1
towards	1
the	1
south	1
became	1
perfectly	1
free	1
when	1
the	1
sailors	1
saw	1
this	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
native	1
country	1
was	1
apparently	1
assured	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
tumultuous	1
joy	1
broke	1
from	1
them	1
loud	1
and	1
long	1
continued	1
frankenstein	1
who	1
was	1
dozing	1
awoke	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
tumult	1
they	1
shout	1
i	1
said	1
because	1
they	1
will	1
soon	1
return	1
to	1
england	1
do	1
you	1
then	1
really	1
return	1
alas	1
yes	1
i	1
cannot	1
withstand	1
their	1
demands	1
i	1
cannot	1
lead	1
them	1
unwillingly	1
to	1
danger	1
and	1
i	1
must	1
return	1
do	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
but	1
i	1
will	1
not	1
you	1
may	1
give	1
up	1
your	1
purpose	1
but	1
mine	1
is	1
assigned	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
heaven	1
and	1
i	1
dare	1
not	1
i	1
am	1
weak	1
but	1
surely	1
the	1
spirits	1
who	1
assist	1
my	1
vengeance	1
will	1
endow	1
me	1
with	1
sufficient	1
strength	1
saying	1
this	1
he	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
spring	1
from	1
the	1
bed	1
but	1
the	1
exertion	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
and	1
fainted	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
restored	1
and	1
i	1
often	1
thought	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
entirely	1
extinct	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
breathed	1
with	1
difficulty	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
surgeon	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
composing	1
draught	1
and	1
ordered	1
us	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
undisturbed	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
friend	1
had	1
certainly	1
not	1
many	1
hours	1
to	1
live	1
his	1
sentence	1
was	1
pronounced	1
and	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
grieve	1
and	1
be	1
patient	1
i	1
sat	1
by	1
his	1
bed	1
watching	1
him	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
slept	1
but	1
presently	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
and	1
bidding	1
me	1
come	1
near	1
said	1
alas	1
the	1
strength	1
i	1
relied	1
on	1
is	1
gone	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
soon	1
die	1
and	1
he	1
my	1
enemy	1
and	1
persecutor	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
in	1
being	1
think	1
not	1
walton	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
i	1
feel	1
that	1
burning	1
hatred	1
and	1
ardent	1
desire	1
of	1
revenge	1
i	1
once	1
expressed	1
but	1
i	1
feel	1
myself	1
justified	1
in	1
desiring	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
adversary	1
during	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
i	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
in	1
examining	1
my	1
past	1
conduct	1
nor	1
do	1
i	1
find	1
it	1
blamable	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
madness	1
i	1
created	1
a	1
rational	1
creature	1
and	1
was	1
bound	1
towards	1
him	1
to	1
assure	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
his	1
happiness	1
and	1
well	1
being	1
this	1
was	1
my	1
duty	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
still	1
paramount	1
to	1
that	1
my	1
duties	1
towards	1
the	1
beings	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
species	1
had	1
greater	1
claims	1
to	1
my	1
attention	1
because	1
they	1
included	1
a	1
greater	1
proportion	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
misery	1
urged	1
by	1
this	1
view	1
i	1
refused	1
and	1
i	1
did	1
right	1
in	1
refusing	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
companion	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
creature	1
he	1
showed	1
unparalleled	1
malignity	1
and	1
selfishness	1
in	1
evil	1
he	1
destroyed	1
my	1
friends	1
he	1
devoted	1
to	1
destruction	1
beings	1
who	1
possessed	1
exquisite	1
sensations	1
happiness	1
and	1
wisdom	1
nor	1
do	1
i	1
know	1
where	1
this	1
thirst	1
for	1
vengeance	1
may	1
end	1
miserable	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
render	1
no	1
other	1
wretched	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
his	1
destruction	1
was	1
mine	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
failed	1
when	1
actuated	1
by	1
selfish	1
and	1
vicious	1
motives	1
i	1
asked	1
you	1
to	1
undertake	1
my	1
unfinished	1
work	1
and	1
i	1
renew	1
this	1
request	1
now	1
when	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
induced	1
by	1
reason	1
and	1
virtue	1
yet	1
i	1
cannot	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
renounce	1
your	1
country	1
and	1
friends	1
to	1
fulfil	1
this	1
task	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
returning	1
to	1
england	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
meeting	1
with	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
these	1
points	1
and	1
the	1
well	1
balancing	1
of	1
what	1

judgment	1

by	1
the	1

dare	1
not	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
i	1

right	1
for	1
i	1
may	1
still	1
be	1

passion	1
that	1

an	1

me	1
in	1

this	1
hour	1

i	1

the	1
only	1
happy	1
one	1
which	1

for	1
several	1
years	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1

before	1
me	1

happiness	1
in	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
avoid	1

it	1

only	1
the	1
apparently	1
innocent	1
one	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
yourself	1
in	1

and	1

why	1
do	1
i	1

blasted	1
in	1

his	1
voice	1
became	1
fainter	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
exhausted	1
by	1
his	1
effort	1
he	1
sank	1
into	1
silence	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
afterwards	1
he	1
attempted	1
again	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
was	1
unable	1
he	1
pressed	1
my	1
hand	1
feebly	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
forever	1
while	1
the	1
irradiation	1
of	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1

comment	1
can	1
i	1
make	1
on	1
the	1
untimely	1
extinction	1
of	1
this	1
glorious	1
spirit	1
what	1
can	1
i	1
say	1
that	1
will	1
enable	1
you	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
my	1
sorrow	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
express	1
would	1
be	1
inadequate	1
and	1
feeble	1
my	1
tears	1
flow	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
overshadowed	1
by	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
disappointment	1
but	1
i	1
journey	1
towards	1
england	1
and	1
i	1
may	1
there	1
find	1
consolation	1
i	1
am	1
interrupted	1
what	1
do	1
these	1
sounds	1
portend	1
it	1
is	1
midnight	1
the	1
breeze	1
blows	1
fairly	1
and	1
the	1
watch	1
on	1
deck	1
scarcely	1
stir	1
again	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
voice	1
but	1
hoarser	1
it	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
cabin	1
where	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
frankenstein	1
still	1
lie	1
i	1
must	1
arise	1
and	1
examine	1
good	1
night	1
my	1
sister	1
great	1
god	1
what	1
a	1
scene	1
has	1
just	1
taken	1
place	1
i	1
am	1
yet	1
dizzy	1
with	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
it	1
i	1
hardly	1
know	1
whether	1
i	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
detail	1
it	1
yet	1
the	1
tale	1
which	1
i	1
have	1
recorded	1
would	1
be	1
incomplete	1
without	1
this	1
final	1
and	1
wonderful	1
catastrophe	1
i	1
entered	1
the	1
cabin	1
where	1
lay	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
my	1
ill	1
fated	1
and	1
admirable	1
friend	1
over	1
him	1
hung	1
a	1
form	1
which	1
i	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
describe	1
gigantic	1
in	1
stature	1
yet	1
uncouth	1
and	1
distorted	1
in	1
its	1
proportions	1
as	1
he	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
coffin	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
concealed	1
by	1
long	1
locks	1
of	1
ragged	1
hair	1
but	1
one	1
vast	1
hand	1
was	1
extended	1
in	1
colour	1
and	1
apparent	1
texture	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
mummy	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
my	1
approach	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
utter	1
exclamations	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
horror	1
and	1
sprung	1
towards	1
the	1
window	1
never	1
did	1
i	1
behold	1
a	1
vision	1
so	1
horrible	1
as	1
his	1
face	1
of	1
such	1
loathsome	1
yet	1
appalling	1
hideousness	1
i	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
involuntarily	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
recollect	1
what	1
were	1
my	1
duties	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
destroyer	1
i	1
called	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
he	1
paused	1
looking	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
again	1
turning	1
towards	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
creator	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
forget	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
every	1
feature	1
and	1
gesture	1
seemed	1
instigated	1
by	1
the	1
wildest	1
rage	1
of	1
some	1
uncontrollable	1
passion	1
that	1
is	1
also	1
my	1
victim	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
his	1
murder	1
my	1
crimes	1
are	1
consummated	1
the	1
miserable	1
series	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
is	1
wound	1
to	1
its	1
close	1
oh	1
frankenstein	1
generous	1
and	1
self	1
devoted	1
being	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
avail	1
that	1
i	1
now	1
ask	1
thee	1
to	1
pardon	1
me	1
i	1
who	1
irretrievably	1
destroyed	1
thee	1
by	1
destroying	1
all	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
alas	1
he	1
is	1
cold	1
he	1
cannot	1
answer	1
me	1
his	1
voice	1
seemed	1
suffocated	1
and	1
my	1
first	1
impulses	1
which	1
had	1
suggested	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
obeying	1
the	1
dying	1
request	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
in	1
destroying	1
his	1
enemy	1
were	1
now	1
suspended	1
by	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
compassion	1
i	1
approached	1
this	1
tremendous	1
being	1
i	1
dared	1
not	1
again	1
raise	1
my	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
so	1
scaring	1
and	1
unearthly	1
in	1
his	1
ugliness	1
i	1
attempted	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
died	1
away	1
on	1
my	1
lips	1
the	1
monster	1
continued	1
to	1
utter	1
wild	1
and	1
incoherent	1
self	1
reproaches	1
at	1
length	1
i	1
gathered	1
resolution	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
the	1
tempest	1
of	1
his	1
passion	1
your	1
repentance	1
i	1
said	1
is	1
now	1
superfluous	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
conscience	1
and	1
heeded	1
the	1
stings	1
of	1
remorse	1
before	1
you	1
had	1
urged	1
your	1
diabolical	1
vengeance	1
to	1
this	1
extremity	1
frankenstein	1
would	1
yet	1
have	1
lived	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
dream	1
said	1
the	1
daemon	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
then	1
dead	1
to	1
agony	1
and	1
remorse	1
he	1
he	1
continued	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
corpse	1
he	1
suffered	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
consummation	1
of	1
the	1
deed	1
oh	1
not	1
the	1
ten	1
thousandth	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
anguish	1
that	1
was	1
mine	1
during	1
the	1
lingering	1
detail	1
of	1
its	1
execution	1
a	1
frightful	1
selfishness	1
hurried	1
me	1
on	1
while	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
poisoned	1
with	1
remorse	1
think	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
groans	1
of	1
clerval	1
were	1
music	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
my	1
heart	1
was	1
fashioned	1
to	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sympathy	1
and	1
when	1
wrenched	1
by	1
misery	1
to	1
vice	1
and	1
hatred	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
endure	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
without	1
torture	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
cannot	1
even	1
imagine	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
clerval	1
i	1
returned	1
to	1
switzerland	1
heart	1
broken	1
and	1
overcome	1
i	1
pitied	1
frankenstein	1
my	1
pity	1
amounted	1
to	1
horror	1
i	1
abhorred	1
myself	1
but	1
when	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
the	1
author	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
my	1
existence	1
and	1
of	1
its	1
unspeakable	1
torments	1
dared	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
happiness	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
accumulated	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
despair	1
upon	1
me	1
he	1
sought	1
his	1
own	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
feelings	1
and	1
passions	1
from	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
forever	1
barred	1
then	1
impotent	1
envy	1
and	1
bitter	1
indignation	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
an	1
insatiable	1
thirst	1
for	1
vengeance	1
i	1
recollected	1
my	1
threat	1
and	1
resolved	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
accomplished	1
i	1
knew	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
preparing	1
for	1
myself	1
a	1
deadly	1
torture	1
but	1
i	1
was	1
the	1
slave	1
not	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
an	1
impulse	1
which	1
i	1
detested	1
yet	1
could	1
not	1
disobey	1
yet	1
when	1
she	1
died	1
nay	1
then	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
miserable	1
i	1
had	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
feeling	1
subdued	1
all	1
anguish	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
my	1
despair	1
evil	1
thenceforth	1
became	1
my	1
good	1
urged	1
thus	1
far	1
i	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
adapt	1
my	1
nature	1
to	1
an	1
element	1
which	1
i	1
had	1
willingly	1
chosen	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
my	1
demoniacal	1
design	1
became	1
an	1
insatiable	1
passion	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
ended	1
there	1
is	1
my	1
last	1
victim	1
i	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
touched	1
by	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
yet	1
when	1
i	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
what	1
frankenstein	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
his	1
powers	1
of	1
eloquence	1
and	1
persuasion	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
again	1
cast	1
my	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
lifeless	1
form	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
indignation	1
was	1
rekindled	1
within	1
me	1
wretch	1
i	1
said	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
whine	1
over	1
the	1
desolation	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
throw	1
a	1
torch	1
into	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
buildings	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
consumed	1
you	1
sit	1
among	1
the	1
ruins	1
and	1
lament	1
the	1
fall	1
hypocritical	1
fiend	1
if	1
he	1
whom	1
you	1
mourn	1
still	1
lived	1
still	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
again	1
would	1
he	1
become	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
your	1
accursed	1
vengeance	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
pity	1
that	1
you	1
feel	1
you	1
lament	1
only	1
because	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
your	1
malignity	1
is	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
your	1
power	1
oh	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
thus	1
not	1
thus	1
interrupted	1
the	1
being	1
yet	1
such	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
impression	1
conveyed	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
my	1
actions	1
yet	1
i	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
fellow	1
feeling	1
in	1
my	1
misery	1
no	1
sympathy	1
may	1
i	1
ever	1
find	1
when	1
i	1
first	1
sought	1
it	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
virtue	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
affection	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
whole	1
being	1
overflowed	1
that	1
i	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
participated	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
virtue	1
has	1
become	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
that	1
happiness	1
and	1
affection	1
are	1
turned	1
into	1
bitter	1
and	1
loathing	1
despair	1
in	1
what	1
should	1
i	1
seek	1
for	1
sympathy	1
i	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
suffer	1
alone	1
while	1
my	1
sufferings	1
shall	1
endure	1
when	1
i	1
die	1
i	1
am	1
well	1
satisfied	1
that	1
abhorrence	1
and	1
opprobrium	1
should	1
load	1
my	1
memory	1
once	1
my	1
fancy	1
was	1
soothed	1
with	1
dreams	1
of	1
virtue	1
of	1
fame	1
and	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
once	1
i	1
falsely	1
hoped	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
beings	1
who	1
pardoning	1
my	1
outward	1
form	1
would	1
love	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
excellent	1
qualities	1
which	1
i	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
unfolding	1
i	1
was	1
nourished	1
with	1
high	1
thoughts	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
devotion	1
but	1
now	1
crime	1
has	1
degraded	1
me	1
beneath	1
the	1
meanest	1
animal	1
no	1
guilt	1
no	1
mischief	1
no	1
malignity	1
no	1
misery	1
can	1
be	1
found	1
comparable	1
to	1
mine	1
when	1
i	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
frightful	1
catalogue	1
of	1
my	1
sins	1
i	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
creature	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
were	1
once	1
filled	1
with	1
sublime	1
and	1
transcendent	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
goodness	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
fallen	1
angel	1
becomes	1
a	1
malignant	1
devil	1
yet	1
even	1
that	1
enemy	1
of	1
god	1
and	1
man	1
had	1
friends	1
and	1
associates	1
in	1
his	1
desolation	1
i	1
am	1
alone	1
you	1
who	1
call	1
frankenstein	1
your	1
friend	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
crimes	1
and	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
detail	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
you	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sum	1
up	1
the	1
hours	1
and	1
months	1
of	1
misery	1
which	1
i	1
endured	1
wasting	1
in	1
impotent	1
passions	1
for	1
while	1
i	1
destroyed	1
his	1
hopes	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
satisfy	1
my	1
own	1
desires	1
they	1
were	1
forever	1
ardent	1
and	1
craving	1
still	1
i	1
desired	1
love	1
and	1
fellowship	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
still	1
spurned	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
injustice	1
in	1
this	1
am	1
i	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
the	1
only	1
criminal	1
when	1
all	1
humankind	1
sinned	1
against	1
me	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
hate	1
felix	1
who	1
drove	1
his	1
friend	1
from	1
his	1
door	1
with	1
contumely	1
why	1

you	1
not	1
execrate	1
the	1
rustic	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1

the	1
saviour	1
of	1
his	1

nay	1
these	1

northern	1
extremity	1

shall	1
collect	1
my	1
funeral	1

i	1
shall	1
no	1

now	1
consume	1

be	1
no	1

the	1

light	1

sense	1
will	1
pass	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
condition	1
must	1
i	1
find	1
my	1
happiness	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
when	1
the	1
images	1
which	1
this	1
world	1
affords	1
first	1
opened	1
upon	1
me	1
when	1
i	1
felt	1
the	1
cheering	1
warmth	1
of	1
summer	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
the	1
warbling	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
me	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
wept	1
to	1
die	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
consolation	1
polluted	1
by	1
crimes	1
and	1
torn	1
by	1
the	1
bitterest	1
remorse	1
where	1
can	1
i	1
find	1
rest	1
but	1
in	1
death	1
farewell	1
i	1
leave	1
you	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
humankind	1
whom	1
these	1
eyes	1
will	1
ever	1
behold	1
farewell	1

alive	1

yet	1
cherished	1
a	1

of	1

against	1
me	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
satiated	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
than	1
in	1
my	1
destruction	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
thou	1
didst	1
seek	1
my	1
extinction	1
that	1
i	1
might	1
not	1
cause	1
greater	1
wretchedness	1
and	1
if	1
yet	1
in	1
some	1
mode	1
unknown	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
feel	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
not	1
desire	1
against	1
me	1
a	1
vengeance	1
greater	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
i	1
feel	1
blasted	1
as	1
thou	1
wert	1
my	1
agony	1
was	1
still	1
superior	1
to	1
thine	1
for	1
the	1
bitter	1
sting	1
of	1
remorse	1
will	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
rankle	1
in	1
my	1
wounds	1
until	1
death	1
shall	1
close	1
them	1
forever	1
but	1
soon	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
sad	1

solemn	1
enthusiasm	1
i	1
shall	1
die	1

what	1

now	1
feel	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
felt	1
soon	1
these	1
burning	1
miseries	1
will	1
be	1
extinct	1
i	1
shall	1
ascend	1
my	1
funeral	1
pile	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
exult	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
the	1
torturing	1
flames	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
that	1
conflagration	1

john	1
clayton	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
he	1
who	1

been	1
tarzan	1

sat	1
in	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
friend	1
lieutenant	1
paul	1
d	1
arnot	1
in	1
paris	1
gazing	1
meditatively	1
at	1
the	1
toe	1
of	1
his	1
immaculate	1
boot	1
his	1
mind	1
revolved	1
many	1
memories	1
recalled	1
by	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
his	1
arch	1
enemy	1
from	1
the	1
french	1
military	1
prison	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sentenced	1
for	1
life	1
upon	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
lengths	1
to	1
which	1
rokoff	1
had	1
once	1
gone	1
to	1
compass	1
his	1
death	1
and	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
already	1
done	1
would	1
doubtless	1
be	1
as	1
nothing	1
by	1
comparison	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
and	1
plot	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
free	1
tarzan	1
had	1
recently	1
brought	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
infant	1
son	1
to	1
london	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
discomforts	1
and	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
rainy	1
season	1
upon	1
their	1
vast	1
estate	1
in	1
uziri	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
waziri	1
warriors	1
whose	1
broad	1
african	1
domains	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
once	1
ruled	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
across	1
the	1
channel	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
visit	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
but	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
escape	1
had	1
already	1
cast	1
a	1
shadow	1
upon	1
his	1
outing	1
so	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
arrived	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
contemplating	1
an	1
immediate	1
return	1
to	1
london	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
i	1
fear	1
for	1
myself	1
paul	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
many	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
have	1
i	1
thwarted	1
rokoff	1
s	1
designs	1
upon	1
my	1
life	1
but	1
now	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
to	1
consider	1
unless	1
i	1
misjudge	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
would	1
more	1
quickly	1
strike	1
at	1
me	1
through	1
my	1
wife	1
or	1
son	1
than	1
directly	1
at	1
me	1
for	1
he	1
doubtless	1
realizes	1
that	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
could	1
he	1
inflict	1
greater	1
anguish	1
upon	1
me	1
i	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
remain	1
with	1
them	1
until	1
rokoff	1
is	1
recaptured	1
or	1
dead	1
as	1
these	1
two	1
talked	1
in	1
paris	1
two	1
other	1
men	1
were	1
talking	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
cottage	1
upon	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
london	1
both	1
were	1
dark	1
sinister	1
looking	1
men	1
one	1
was	1
bearded	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
whose	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
pallor	1
of	1
long	1
confinement	1
within	1
doors	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
growth	1
of	1
black	1
beard	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
speaking	1
you	1
must	1
needs	1
shave	1
off	1
that	1
beard	1
of	1
yours	1
alexis	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
companion	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
recognize	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
instant	1
we	1
must	1
separate	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
meet	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
let	1
us	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
with	1
us	1
two	1
honoured	1
guests	1
who	1
little	1
anticipate	1
the	1
pleasant	1
voyage	1
we	1
have	1
planned	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
hours	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
upon	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
dover	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
night	1
if	1
you	1
follow	1
my	1
instructions	1
carefully	1
you	1
should	1
arrive	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
provided	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
he	1
returns	1
to	1
london	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
i	1
presume	1
he	1
will	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
both	1
profit	1
and	1
pleasure	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
other	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
reward	1
our	1
efforts	1
my	1
dear	1
alexis	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
stupidity	1
of	1
the	1
french	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
such	1
lengths	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
my	1
escape	1
for	1
these	1
many	1
days	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
had	1
ample	1
opportunity	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
our	1
little	1
adventure	1
so	1
carefully	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
the	1
slightest	1
hitch	1
occurring	1
to	1
mar	1
our	1
prospects	1
and	1
now	1
good	1
bye	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
three	1
hours	1
later	1
a	1
messenger	1
mounted	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
apartment	1
of	1
lieutenant	1
d	1
arnot	1
a	1
telegram	1
for	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
answered	1
his	1
summons	1
is	1
he	1
here	1
the	1
man	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
and	1
signing	1
for	1
the	1
message	1
carried	1
it	1
within	1
to	1
tarzan	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart	1
for	1
london	1
tarzan	1
tore	1
open	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
his	1
face	1
went	1
white	1
read	1
it	1
paul	1
he	1
said	1
handing	1
the	1
slip	1
of	1
paper	1
to	1
d	1
arnot	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
already	1
the	1
frenchman	1
took	1
the	1
telegram	1
and	1
read	1
jack	1
stolen	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
through	1
complicity	1
of	1
new	1
servant	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
jane	1
as	1
tarzan	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
roadster	1
that	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
his	1
london	1
town	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
by	1
a	1
dry	1
eyed	1
but	1
almost	1
frantic	1
woman	1
quickly	1
jane	1
porter	1
clayton	1
narrated	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
learn	1
of	1
the	1
theft	1
of	1
the	1
boy	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
nurse	1
had	1
been	1
wheeling	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
on	1
the	1
walk	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
a	1
closed	1
taxicab	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
paid	1
but	1
passing	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
vehicle	1
merely	1
noting	1
that	1
it	1
discharged	1
no	1
passenger	1
but	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
kerb	1
with	1
the	1
motor	1
running	1
as	1
though	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
fare	1
from	1
the	1
residence	1
before	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
stopped	1
almost	1
immediately	1
the	1
new	1
houseman	1
carl	1
had	1
come	1
running	1
from	1
the	1
greystoke	1
house	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
girl	1
s	1
mistress	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
little	1
jack	1
in	1
his	1
care	1
until	1
she	1
returned	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
entertained	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
motives	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
when	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
warn	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
carriage	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
permit	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
call	1
this	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
somewhat	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wheeling	1
the	1
carriage	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
taxicab	1
open	1
and	1
a	1
swarthy	1
face	1
framed	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
aperture	1
intuitively	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
child	1
flashed	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shriek	1
she	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
steps	1
and	1
up	1
the	1
walk	1
toward	1
the	1
taxicab	1
into	1
which	1
carl	1
was	1
now	1
handing	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
the	1
swarthy	1
one	1
within	1
just	1
before	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
vehicle	1
carl	1
leaped	1
in	1
beside	1
his	1
confederate	1
slamming	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
chauffeur	1
attempted	1
to	1
start	1
his	1
machine	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
gone	1
wrong	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
gears	1
refused	1
to	1
mesh	1
and	1
the	1
delay	1
caused	1
by	1
this	1
while	1
he	1
pushed	1
the	1
lever	1
into	1
reverse	1
and	1
backed	1
the	1
car	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
before	1
again	1
attempting	1
to	1
go	1
ahead	1
gave	1
the	1
nurse	1
time	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
taxicab	1
leaping	1
to	1
the	1
running	1
board	1
she	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
snatch	1
the	1
baby	1
from	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
and	1
here	1
screaming	1
and	1
fighting	1
she	1
had	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
position	1
even	1
after	1
the	1
taxicab	1
had	1
got	1
under	1
way	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
machine	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
greystoke	1
residence	1
at	1
good	1
speed	1
that	1
carl	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
blow	1
to	1
her	1
face	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
knocking	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
pavement	1
her	1
screams	1
had	1
attracted	1
servants	1
and	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
from	1
residences	1
near	1
by	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
greystoke	1
home	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
had	1
witnessed	1
the	1
girl	1
s	1
brave	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
herself	1
tried	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
rapidly	1
passing	1
vehicle	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
late	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
anyone	1
knew	1
nor	1
did	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
dream	1
of	1
the	1
possible	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
plot	1
until	1
her	1
husband	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
from	1
the	1
french	1
prison	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
hoped	1
he	1
was	1
permanently	1
confined	1
as	1
tarzan	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
stood	1
planning	1
the	1
wisest	1
course	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
telephone	1
bell	1
rang	1
in	1
the	1
library	1
at	1
their	1
right	1
tarzan	1
quickly	1
answered	1
the	1
call	1
in	1
person	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
asked	1
a	1
man	1
s	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
yes	1
your	1
son	1
has	1
been	1
stolen	1
continued	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
i	1
alone	1
may	1
help	1
you	1
to	1
recover	1
him	1
i	1
am	1
conversant	1
with	1
the	1
plot	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
fact	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
party	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
reward	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
trying	1
to	1
ditch	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
quits	1
with	1
them	1
i	1
will	1
aid	1
you	1
to	1
recover	1
him	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
prosecute	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
crime	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
if	1
you	1
lead	1
me	1
to	1
where	1
my	1

hidden	1
replied	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
you	1
need	1
fear	1
nothing	1
from	1
me	1
good	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
alone	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
that	1
i	1
must	1
trust	1
you	1
i	1
cannot	1
take	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
permitting	1
others	1
to	1
learn	1
my	1
identity	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
may	1
i	1
meet	1
you	1
asked	1
tarzan	1
the	1

the	1

and	1
location	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
house	1
on	1
the	1

at	1
dover	1
a	1
place	1
frequented	1
by	1
sailors	1
come	1
he	1
concluded	1
about	1
ten	1
o	1
clock	1
tonight	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
arrive	1
earlier	1
your	1

will	1
be	1
safe	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
i	1
can	1
then	1
lead	1
you	1
secretly	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
hidden	1
but	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
alone	1
and	1
under	1
no	1
circumstances	1
notify	1
scotland	1

for	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
well	1

shall	1
be	1
watching	1
for	1
you	1

any	1

should	1
i	1

suspicious	1
characters	1
who	1
might	1

i	1
shall	1
not	1

you	1

your	1
last	1
chance	1
of	1
recovering	1
your	1
son	1
will	1
be	1
gone	1
without	1
more	1
words	1
the	1
man	1
rang	1
off	1
tarzan	1
repeated	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
she	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
insisted	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
result	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
threat	1
of	1
refusing	1
to	1
aid	1
them	1
if	1
tarzan	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
alone	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
parted	1
he	1
to	1
hasten	1
to	1
dover	1
and	1
she	1
ostensibly	1
to	1
wait	1
at	1
home	1
until	1
he	1
should	1
notify	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
his	1
mission	1
little	1
did	1
either	1
dream	1
of	1
what	1
both	1
were	1
destined	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
before	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
again	1
or	1
the	1
far	1
distant	1
but	1
why	1
anticipate	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes	1
after	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
jane	1
clayton	1
walked	1
restlessly	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
across	1
the	1
silken	1
rugs	1
of	1
the	1
library	1
her	1
mother	1
heart	1
ached	1
bereft	1
of	1
its	1
first	1
born	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
anguish	1
of	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears	1
though	1
her	1
judgment	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
were	1
her	1
tarzan	1
to	1
go	1
alone	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
mysterious	1
stranger	1
s	1
summons	1
her	1
intuition	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
her	1
to	1
lay	1
aside	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
gravest	1
dangers	1
to	1
both	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
the	1
more	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
the	1
more	1
convinced	1
she	1
became	1
that	1
the	1
recent	1
telephone	1
message	1
might	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
ruse	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
inactive	1
until	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
safely	1
hidden	1
away	1
or	1
spirited	1
out	1
of	1
england	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
simply	1
a	1
bait	1
to	1
lure	1
tarzan	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
implacable	1
rokoff	1
with	1
the	1
lodgment	1
of	1
this	1
thought	1
she	1
stopped	1
in	1
wide	1
eyed	1
terror	1
instantly	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
conviction	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
clock	1
ticking	1
the	1
minutes	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
library	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
dover	1
train	1
that	1
tarzan	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
later	1
however	1
that	1
would	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
channel	1
port	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
address	1
the	1
stranger	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
husband	1
before	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
summoning	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
chauffeur	1
she	1
issued	1
instructions	1
rapidly	1
ten	1
minutes	1
later	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
whisked	1
through	1
the	1
crowded	1
streets	1
toward	1
the	1
railway	1
station	1
it	1
was	1
nine	1
forty	1
five	1
that	1
night	1
that	1
tarzan	1
entered	1
the	1
squalid	1
pub	1
on	1
the	1
water	1
front	1
in	1
dover	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
evil	1
smelling	1
room	1
a	1
muffled	1
figure	1
brushed	1
past	1
him	1
toward	1
the	1
street	1
come	1
my	1
lord	1
whispered	1
the	1
stranger	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
wheeled	1
about	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
other	1
into	1
the	1
ill	1
lit	1
alley	1
which	1
custom	1
had	1
dignified	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
thoroughfare	1
once	1
outside	1
the	1
fellow	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
nearer	1
a	1
wharf	1
where	1
high	1
piled	1
bales	1
boxes	1
and	1
casks	1
cast	1
dense	1
shadows	1
here	1
he	1
halted	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
boy	1
asked	1
greystoke	1
on	1
that	1
small	1
steamer	1
whose	1
lights	1
you	1
can	1
just	1
see	1
yonder	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
gloom	1
tarzan	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
peer	1
into	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
the	1
man	1
as	1
one	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
seen	1
had	1
he	1
guessed	1
that	1
his	1
guide	1
was	1
alexis	1
paulvitch	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
realized	1
that	1
naught	1
but	1
treachery	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
heart	1
and	1
that	1
danger	1
lurked	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
every	1
move	1
he	1
is	1
unguarded	1
now	1
continued	1
the	1
russian	1
those	1
who	1
took	1
him	1
feel	1
perfectly	1
safe	1
from	1
detection	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
whom	1
i	1
have	1
furnished	1
with	1
enough	1
gin	1
to	1
silence	1
them	1
effectually	1
for	1
hours	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
we	1
can	1
go	1
aboard	1
get	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
return	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
fear	1
tarzan	1
nodded	1
let	1
s	1
be	1
about	1
it	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
guide	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
boat	1
moored	1
alongside	1
the	1
wharf	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
entered	1
and	1
paulvitch	1
pulled	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
the	1
steamer	1
the	1
black	1
smoke	1
issuing	1
from	1
her	1
funnel	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
make	1
any	1
suggestion	1
to	1
tarzan	1
s	1
mind	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
he	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
his	1
little	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
at	1
the	1
steamer	1
s	1
side	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
monkey	1
ladder	1
dangling	1
close	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
up	1
this	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
crept	1
stealthily	1
once	1
on	1
deck	1
they	1
hastened	1
aft	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
russian	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
hatch	1
the	1
boy	1
is	1
hidden	1
there	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
down	1
after	1
him	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
less	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
cry	1
in	1
fright	1
than	1
should	1
he	1
find	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
a	1
stranger	1
i	1
will	1
stand	1
on	1
guard	1
here	1
so	1
anxious	1
was	1
tarzan	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
surrounding	1
the	1
kincaid	1
that	1
her	1
deck	1
was	1
deserted	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
steam	1
up	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
smoke	1
pouring	1
from	1
her	1
funnel	1
was	1
all	1
ready	1
to	1
get	1
under	1
way	1
made	1
no	1
impression	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
another	1
instant	1
he	1
would	1
fold	1
that	1
precious	1
little	1
bundle	1
of	1
humanity	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
swung	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
below	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
released	1
his	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
hatch	1
than	1
the	1
heavy	1
covering	1
fell	1
clattering	1
above	1
him	1
instantly	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
a	1
plot	1
and	1
that	1
far	1
from	1
rescuing	1
his	1
son	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
enemies	1
though	1
he	1
immediately	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
hatch	1
and	1
lift	1
the	1
cover	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
striking	1
a	1
match	1
he	1
explored	1
his	1
surroundings	1
finding	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
compartment	1
had	1
been	1
partitioned	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
hold	1
with	1
the	1
hatch	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
ingress	1
or	1
egress	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
purpose	1
of	1
serving	1
as	1
a	1
cell	1
for	1
himself	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
compartment	1
and	1
no	1
other	1
occupant	1
if	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
kincaid	1
he	1
was	1
confined	1
elsewhere	1
for	1
over	1
twenty	1
years	1
from	1
infancy	1
to	1
manhood	1

had	1
roamed	1
his	1
savage	1
jungle	1
haunts	1
without	1
human	1
companionship	1
of	1
any	1
nature	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
impressionable	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
pleasures	1
and	1
his	1
sorrows	1
as	1
the	1
beasts	1
take	1
theirs	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
raved	1
nor	1
stormed	1
against	1
fate	1
but	1
instead	1
waited	1
patiently	1
for	1
what	1

to	1
doing	1
the	1

to	1
succour	1
himself	1
to	1

he	1
examined	1
his	1
prison	1
carefully	1
tested	1
the	1
heavy	1
planking	1
that	1
formed	1
its	1
walls	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
hatch	1
above	1
him	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
occupied	1
there	1
came	1
suddenly	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
vibration	1
of	1
machinery	1
and	1
the	1
throbbing	1
of	1
the	1
propeller	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
moving	1
where	1
to	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
fate	1
was	1
it	1
carrying	1
him	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
these	1
thoughts	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
ears	1
above	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
engines	1
that	1
which	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
cold	1
with	1
apprehension	1
clear	1
and	1
shrill	1
from	1
the	1
deck	1
above	1
him	1
rang	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
frightened	1
woman	1
chapter	1
2	1
marooned	1
as	1
tarzan	1
and	1
his	1
guide	1
had	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
shadows	1
upon	1
the	1
dark	1
wharf	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
heavily	1
veiled	1
woman	1
had	1
hurried	1
down	1
the	1
narrow	1
alley	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
drinking	1
place	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
had	1
just	1
quitted	1
here	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
though	1
satisfied	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
she	1
sought	1
she	1
pushed	1
bravely	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
vile	1
den	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
half	1
drunken	1
sailors	1
and	1
wharf	1
rats	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
unaccustomed	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
richly	1
gowned	1
woman	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
rapidly	1
she	1
approached	1
the	1
slovenly	1
barmaid	1
who	1
stared	1
half	1
in	1
envy	1
half	1
in	1
hate	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
fortunate	1
sister	1
have	1
you	1
seen	1
a	1
tall	1
well	1
dressed	1
man	1
here	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
since	1
she	1
asked	1
who	1
met	1
another	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
girl	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
which	1
way	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
sailor	1
who	1
had	1
approached	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
vouchsafed	1
the	1
information	1
that	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
pub	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
two	1
men	1
leaving	1
it	1
who	1
walked	1
toward	1
the	1
wharf	1
show	1
me	1
the	1
direction	1
they	1
went	1
cried	1
the	1
woman	1
slipping	1
a	1
coin	1
into	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
hand	1
the	1
fellow	1
led	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
together	1
they	1
walked	1
quickly	1
toward	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
along	1
it	1
until	1
across	1
the	1
water	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
small	1
boat	1
just	1
pulling	1
into	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
a	1
near	1
by	1
steamer	1
there	1
they	1
be	1
whispered	1
the	1
man	1
ten	1
pounds	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
boat	1
and	1
row	1
me	1
to	1
that	1
steamer	1
cried	1
the	1
woman	1
quick	1
then	1
he	1
replied	1
for	1
we	1
gotta	1
go	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
re	1
goin	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
kincaid	1
afore	1
she	1
sails	1
she	1
s	1
had	1
steam	1
up	1
for	1
three	1
hours	1
an	1
jest	1
been	1
a	1
waitin	1
fer	1
that	1
one	1
passenger	1
i	1
was	1
a	1
talkin	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
crew	1
arf	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
wharf	1
where	1
he	1
knew	1
another	1
boat	1
lay	1
moored	1
and	1
lowering	1
the	1
woman	1
into	1
it	1
he	1
jumped	1
in	1
after	1
and	1
pushed	1
off	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
soon	1
scudding	1
over	1
the	1
water	1
at	1
the	1
steamer	1
s	1
side	1
the	1
man	1
demanded	1
his	1
pay	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
count	1
out	1
the	1
exact	1
amount	1
the	1
woman	1
thrust	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
bank	1
notes	1
into	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
a	1
single	1
glance	1
at	1
them	1
convinced	1
the	1
fellow	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
well	1
paid	1
then	1
he	1
assisted	1
her	1
up	1
the	1
ladder	1
holding	1
his	1
skiff	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
against	1
the	1
chance	1
that	1
this	1
profitable	1
passenger	1
might	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
ashore	1
later	1
but	1
presently	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
donkey	1
engine	1
and	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
a	1
steel	1
cable	1
on	1
the	1
hoisting	1
drum	1
proclaimed	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
anchor	1
was	1
being	1
raised	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
waiter	1
heard	1
the	1
propellers	1
revolving	1
and	1
slowly	1
the	1
little	1
steamer	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
channel	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
row	1
back	1
to	1
shore	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
shriek	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
deck	1
that	1
s	1
wot	1
i	1
calls	1
rotten	1
luck	1
he	1
soliloquized	1
i	1
might	1

as	1
well	1
of	1
ad	1
the	1
whole	1
bloomin	1
wad	1
when	1
jane	1
clayton	1
climbed	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
ship	1
apparently	1
deserted	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
those	1
she	1
sought	1
nor	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
aboard	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
about	1
her	1
search	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
she	1
hoped	1
against	1
hope	1
to	1
find	1
there	1
without	1
interruption	1
quickly	1
she	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
cabin	1
which	1
was	1
half	1
above	1
and	1
half	1
below	1
deck	1
as	1
she	1
hurried	1
down	1
the	1
short	1
companion	1
ladder	1
into	1
the	1
main	1
cabin	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
smaller	1
rooms	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
she	1
failed	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
quick	1
closing	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
before	1
her	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
full	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
room	1
and	1
then	1
retracing	1
her	1
steps	1
stopped	1
before	1
each	1
door	1
to	1
listen	1
furtively	1
trying	1
each	1
latch	1
all	1
was	1
silence	1
utter	1
silence	1
there	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
throbbing	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
frightened	1
heart	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
overwrought	1
imagination	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
its	1
thunderous	1
alarm	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
doors	1
opened	1
before	1
her	1
touch	1
only	1
to	1
reveal	1
empty	1
interiors	1
in	1
her	1
absorption	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
note	1
the	1
sudden	1
activity	1
upon	1
the	1
vessel	1
the	1
purring	1
of	1
the	1
engines	1
the	1
throbbing	1
of	1
the	1
propeller	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
last	1
door	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
now	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
pushed	1
it	1
open	1
she	1
was	1
seized	1
from	1
within	1
by	1
a	1
powerful	1
dark	1
visaged	1
man	1
and	1
drawn	1
hastily	1
into	1
the	1
stuffy	1
ill	1
smelling	1
interior	1
the	1
sudden	1
shock	1
of	1
fright	1
which	1
the	1
unexpected	1
attack	1
had	1
upon	1
her	1
drew	1
a	1
single	1
piercing	1
scream	1
from	1
her	1
throat	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
clapped	1
a	1
hand	1
roughly	1
over	1
the	1
mouth	1
not	1
until	1
we	1
are	1
farther	1
from	1
land	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
said	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
yell	1
your	1
pretty	1
head	1
off	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
leering	1
bearded	1
face	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
the	1
man	1
relaxed	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
upon	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
moan	1
of	1
terror	1
as	1
she	1
recognized	1
him	1
the	1
girl	1
shrank	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
captor	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
m	1
thuran	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
your	1
devoted	1
admirer	1
replied	1
the	1
russian	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
my	1
little	1
boy	1
she	1
said	1
next	1
ignoring	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
endearment	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
him	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
cruel	1
even	1
as	1
you	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
cannot	1
be	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
compassion	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
is	1
he	1
aboard	1
this	1
ship	1
oh	1
please	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
heart	1
beats	1
within	1
your	1
breast	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
baby	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
bid	1
no	1
harm	1
will	1
befall	1
him	1
replied	1
rokoff	1
but	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
fault	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
you	1
came	1
aboard	1
voluntarily	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
consequences	1
i	1
little	1
thought	1
he	1
added	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
any	1
such	1
good	1
luck	1
as	1
this	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
deck	1
then	1
locking	1
the	1
cabin	1
door	1
upon	1
his	1
prisoner	1
and	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
being	1
that	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
was	1
so	1
poor	1
a	1
sailor	1
that	1
the	1
heavy	1
seas	1
the	1
kincaid	1
encountered	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
her	1
voyage	1
sent	1
the	1
russian	1
to	1
his	1
berth	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
attack	1
of	1
sea	1
sickness	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
her	1
only	1
visitor	1
was	1
an	1
uncouth	1
swede	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
unsavoury	1
cook	1
who	1
brought	1
her	1
meals	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
sven	1
anderssen	1
his	1
one	1
pride	1
being	1
that	1
his	1
patronymic	1
was	1
spelt	1
with	1
a	1
double	1
s	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
raw	1
boned	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
yellow	1
moustache	1
an	1
unwholesome	1
complexion	1
and	1
filthy	1
nails	1
the	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
grimy	1
thumb	1
buried	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
lukewarm	1
stew	1
that	1
seemed	1
from	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
its	1
repetition	1
to	1
constitute	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
his	1
culinary	1
art	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
girl	1
s	1
appetite	1
his	1
small	1
blue	1
close	1
set	1
eyes	1
never	1
met	1
hers	1
squarely	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
shiftiness	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
appearance	1
that	1
even	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
cat	1
like	1
manner	1
of	1
his	1
gait	1
and	1
to	1
it	1
all	1
a	1
sinister	1
suggestion	1
was	1
added	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
slim	1
knife	1
that	1
always	1
rested	1
at	1
his	1
waist	1
slipped	1
through	1
the	1
greasy	1
cord	1
that	1
supported	1
his	1
soiled	1
apron	1
ostensibly	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
implement	1
of	1
his	1
calling	1
but	1
the	1
girl	1
could	1
never	1
free	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
less	1
provocation	1
to	1
witness	1
it	1
put	1
to	1
other	1
and	1
less	1
harmless	1
uses	1
his	1
manner	1
toward	1
her	1
was	1
surly	1
yet	1
she	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
and	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
thanks	1
when	1
he	1
brought	1
her	1
food	1
to	1
her	1
though	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
not	1
she	1
hurled	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
tiny	1
cabin	1
port	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
closed	1
behind	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
anguish	1
that	1
followed	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
imprisonment	1
but	1
two	1
questions	1
were	1
uppermost	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
son	1
she	1
fully	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
provided	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
lived	1
but	1
whether	1
tarzan	1
had	1
been	1
permitted	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
lured	1
aboard	1
the	1
evil	1
craft	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
deep	1
hatred	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
englishman	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
but	1
one	1
reason	1
for	1
having	1
him	1
brought	1
aboard	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
dispatch	1
him	1
in	1
comparative	1
safety	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
thwarted	1
rokoff	1
s	1
pet	1
schemes	1
and	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
landing	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
french	1
prison	1
tarzan	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
his	1
cell	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
almost	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
same	1
swede	1
that	1
served	1
jane	1
brought	1
his	1
meals	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
though	1
on	1
several	1
occasions	1
tarzan	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
man	1
into	1
conversation	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unsuccessful	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
learn	1
through	1
this	1
fellow	1
whether	1
his	1
little	1
son	1
was	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
but	1
to	1
every	1
question	1
upon	1
this	1
or	1
kindred	1
subjects	1
the	1
fellow	1
returned	1
but	1
one	1
reply	1
ay	1
tank	1
it	1
blow	1
purty	1
soon	1
purty	1
hard	1
so	1
after	1
several	1
attempts	1
tarzan	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
weeks	1
that	1
seemed	1
months	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
prisoners	1
the	1
little	1
steamer	1
forged	1
on	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
where	1
once	1
the	1
kincaid	1
stopped	1
to	1
coal	1
only	1
immediately	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
seemingly	1
interminable	1
voyage	1
rokoff	1
had	1
visited	1
jane	1
clayton	1
but	1
once	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
locked	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
tiny	1
cabin	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
gaunt	1
and	1
hollow	1
eyed	1
from	1
a	1
long	1
siege	1
of	1
sea	1
sickness	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
was	1
to	1
obtain	1
from	1
her	1
her	1
personal	1
cheque	1
for	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
a	1
guarantee	1
of	1
her	1
personal	1
safety	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
england	1
when	1
you	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
safely	1
in	1
any	1
civilized	1
port	1
together	1
with	1
my	1
son	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
she	1
replied	1
i	1
will	1
pay	1
you	1
in	1
gold	1
twice	1
the	1
amount	1
you	1
ask	1
but	1
until	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
cent	1
nor	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
cent	1
under	1
any	1
other	1
conditions	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
cheque	1
i	1
ask	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
snarl	1
or	1
neither	1
you	1
nor	1
your	1
child	1
nor	1
your	1
husband	1
will	1
ever	1
again	1
set	1
foot	1
within	1
any	1
port	1
civilized	1
or	1
otherwise	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
trust	1
you	1
she	1
replied	1
what	1
guarantee	1
have	1
i	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
my	1
money	1
and	1
then	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
pleased	1
with	1
me	1
and	1
mine	1
regardless	1
of	1
your	1
promise	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
as	1
i	1
bid	1
he	1
said	1
turning	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
cabin	1
remember	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
your	1
son	1
if	1
you	1
chance	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
agonized	1
wail	1
of	1
a	1
tortured	1
child	1
it	1
may	1
console	1
you	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
stubbornness	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
suffers	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
baby	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
cried	1
the	1
girl	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
fiendishly	1
cruel	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
i	1
that	1
am	1
cruel	1
but	1
you	1
he	1
returned	1
for	1
you	1
permit	1
a	1
paltry	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
stand	1
between	1
your	1
baby	1
and	1
immunity	1
from	1
suffering	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
jane	1
clayton	1
wrote	1
out	1
a	1
cheque	1
of	1
large	1
denomination	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
who	1
left	1
her	1
cabin	1
with	1
a	1
grin	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
upon	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
the	1
hatch	1
was	1
removed	1
from	1
tarzan	1
s	1
cell	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
he	1
saw	1

framed	1
in	1
the	1

above	1

up	1
commanded	1
the	1
russian	1
but	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
shot	1
if	1
you	1
make	1
a	1
single	1
move	1
to	1
attack	1
me	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
aboard	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
ape	1

swung	1
himself	1
lightly	1
to	1
the	1

about	1
him	1

at	1
a	1

distance	1
stood	1
a	1

looked	1
about	1
for	1
rokoff	1
who	1

there	1
was	1

by	1
your	1

with	1

his	1

you	1
have	1
at	1
last	1
brought	1
yourself	1
and	1
your	1
family	1
to	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
extremity	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
yourself	1
to	1
thank	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
m	1
rokoff	1
a	1
large	1
amount	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
finance	1
this	1
expedition	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
sole	1
cause	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
naturally	1
looks	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
reimbursement	1
further	1
i	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
meeting	1
m	1
rokoff	1
s	1
just	1

may	1
you	1
avert	1
the	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
consequences	1
to	1
your	1
wife	1

child	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
retain	1
your	1
own	1
life	1
and	1
regain	1
your	1
liberty	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
amount	1
asked	1
tarzan	1
and	1
what	1
assurance	1
have	1
i	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
live	1
up	1
to	1
your	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
agreement	1
i	1
have	1
little	1
reason	1
to	1
trust	1
two	1
such	1
scoundrels	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
rokoff	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
russian	1
flushed	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
no	1
position	1
to	1
deliver	1
insults	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
assurance	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
live	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
agreement	1
other	1
than	1
my	1
word	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
make	1
short	1
work	1
of	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
write	1
out	1
the	1
cheque	1
we	1
demand	1
unless	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
greater	1
fool	1
than	1
i	1
imagine	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
that	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
than	1
to	1
order	1
these	1
men	1
to	1
fire	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
other	1
plans	1
for	1
punishing	1
you	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
entirely	1
upset	1
by	1
your	1
death	1
answer	1
one	1
question	1
said	1
tarzan	1
is	1
my	1
son	1
on	1
board	1
this	1
ship	1
no	1
replied	1
alexis	1
paulvitch	1
your	1
son	1
is	1
quite	1
safe	1
elsewhere	1
nor	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
killed	1
until	1
you	1
refuse	1
to	1
accede	1
to	1
our	1
fair	1
demands	1
if	1
it	1
becomes	1
necessary	1
to	1
kill	1
you	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
not	1
killing	1
the	1
child	1
since	1
with	1
you	1
gone	1
the	1
one	1
whom	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
punish	1
through	1
the	1
boy	1
will	1
be	1
gone	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
to	1
us	1
only	1
a	1
constant	1
source	1
of	1
danger	1
and	1
embarrassment	1
you	1
see	1
therefore	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
only	1
save	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
your	1
son	1
by	1
saving	1
your	1
own	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
save	1
your	1
own	1
by	1
giving	1
us	1
the	1
cheque	1
we	1
ask	1
very	1
well	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
trust	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
any	1
sinister	1
threat	1
that	1
paulvitch	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bare	1
chance	1
that	1
by	1
conceding	1
their	1
demands	1
he	1
might	1
save	1
the	1
boy	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
appended	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
the	1
cheque	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
being	1
within	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
probability	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
such	1
a	1
battle	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
forget	1
and	1
possibly	1
to	1
take	1
paulvitch	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
eternity	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
sorry	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
rokoff	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
pocket	1
cheque	1
book	1
and	1
fountain	1
pen	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
amount	1
he	1
asked	1
paulvitch	1
named	1
an	1
enormous	1
sum	1
tarzan	1
could	1
scarce	1
restrain	1
a	1
smile	1
their	1
very	1
cupidity	1
was	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
their	1
undoing	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
ransom	1
at	1
least	1
purposely	1
he	1
hesitated	1
and	1
haggled	1
over	1
the	1
amount	1
but	1
paulvitch	1
was	1
obdurate	1
finally	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
wrote	1
out	1
his	1
cheque	1
for	1
a	1
larger	1
sum	1
than	1
stood	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
at	1
the	1
bank	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
hand	1
the	1
worthless	1
slip	1
of	1
paper	1
to	1
the	1
russian	1
his	1
glance	1
chanced	1
to	1
pass	1
across	1
the	1
starboard	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
lay	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
of	1
land	1
almost	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
s	1
edge	1
ran	1
a	1
dense	1
tropical	1
jungle	1
and	1
behind	1
was	1
higher	1
land	1
clothed	1
in	1
forest	1
paulvitch	1
noted	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
gaze	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
here	1
he	1
said	1
tarzan	1
s	1
plan	1
for	1
immediate	1
physical	1
revenge	1
upon	1
the	1
russian	1
vanished	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
land	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
mainland	1
of	1
africa	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
should	1
they	1
liberate	1
him	1
here	1
he	1
could	1
doubtless	1
find	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
civilization	1
with	1
comparative	1
ease	1
paulvitch	1
took	1
the	1
cheque	1
remove	1
your	1
clothing	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
here	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
need	1
it	1
tarzan	1
demurred	1
paulvitch	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
armed	1
sailors	1
then	1
the	1
englishman	1
slowly	1
divested	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
clothing	1
a	1
boat	1
was	1
lowered	1
and	1
still	1
heavily	1
guarded	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
rowed	1
ashore	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
sailors	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
kincaid	1
and	1
the	1
steamer	1
was	1
slowly	1
getting	1
under	1
way	1
as	1
tarzan	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
narrow	1
strip	1
of	1
beach	1
watching	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
figure	1
appear	1
at	1
the	1
rail	1
and	1
call	1
aloud	1
to	1
attract	1
his	1
attention	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
about	1
to	1
read	1
a	1
note	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
had	1
handed	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
boat	1
that	1
bore	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
steamer	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
hail	1
from	1
the	1
vessel	1
s	1
deck	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
black	1
bearded	1
man	1
who	1
laughed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
derision	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
high	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
tarzan	1
half	1
started	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
rush	1
through	1
the	1
surf	1
and	1
strike	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
already	1
moving	1
steamer	1
but	1
realizing	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
so	1
rash	1
an	1
act	1
he	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
s	1
edge	1
thus	1
he	1
stood	1
his	1
gaze	1
riveted	1
upon	1
the	1
kincaid	1
until	1
it	1
disappeared	1
beyond	1
a	1
projecting	1
promontory	1
of	1
the	1
coast	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
at	1
his	1
back	1
fierce	1
bloodshot	1
eyes	1
glared	1
from	1
beneath	1
shaggy	1
overhanging	1
brows	1
upon	1
him	1
little	1
monkeys	1
in	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
chattered	1
and	1
scolded	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
inland	1
forest	1
came	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
leopard	1
but	1
still	1
john	1
clayton	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
stood	1
deaf	1
and	1
unseeing	1
suffering	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
keen	1
regret	1
for	1
the	1
opportunity	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wasted	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
gullible	1
as	1
to	1
place	1
credence	1
in	1
a	1

too	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1

behind	1
him	1
the	1
hairy	1
thing	1

evil	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
cat	1

creeping	1
stealthily	1
toward	1

slowly	1

unfolded	1

the	1

had	1
thrust	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
it	1
made	1
little	1
impression	1
on	1
his	1

but	1
finally	1
the	1
full	1
purport	1
of	1
the	1
hideous	1
plot	1
of	1

unfolded	1
itself	1
before	1
his	1

explain	1
to	1

instantly	1
his	1

he	1
was	1
again	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
as	1
he	1
wheeled	1
about	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
beast	1
at	1
bay	1
vibrant	1
with	1
the	1
instinct	1
of	1
self	1
preservation	1
that	1
faced	1
a	1
huge	1
bull	1
ape	1
that	1
was	1
already	1
charging	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
two	1
years	1
that	1
had	1
elapsed	1

tarzan	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
forest	1
with	1
his	1
rescued	1
mate	1
had	1
witnessed	1
slight	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
powers	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
the	1
invincible	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
his	1
great	1
estates	1
in	1
uziri	1
had	1
claimed	1
much	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
attention	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
ample	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
practical	1
use	1
and	1
retention	1
of	1
his	1
almost	1
superhuman	1
powers	1
but	1
naked	1
and	1
unarmed	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
shaggy	1
bull	1
necked	1
beast	1
that	1
now	1
confronted	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
test	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
would	1
scarce	1
have	1
welcomed	1
at	1
any	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
wild	1
existence	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
alternative	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
rage	1
maddened	1
creature	1
with	1
the	1
weapons	1
with	1
which	1
nature	1
had	1
endowed	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
bull	1
s	1
shoulder	1
tarzan	1
could	1
see	1
now	1
the	1
heads	1
and	1
shoulders	1
of	1
perhaps	1
a	1
dozen	1
more	1
of	1
these	1
mighty	1
fore	1
runners	1
of	1
primitive	1
man	1
he	1
knew	1
however	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
chance	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
attack	1
him	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
reasoning	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
weigh	1
or	1
appreciate	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
concentrated	1
action	1
against	1
an	1
enemy	1
otherwise	1
they	1
would	1
long	1

have	1
become	1

tremendous	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
destruction	1
lies	1
in	1
their	1
mighty	1
thews	1
and	1
savage	1
fangs	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
snarl	1
the	1
beast	1
now	1
hurled	1
himself	1
at	1
tarzan	1
but	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
found	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
haunts	1
of	1
civilized	1
man	1
certain	1
methods	1
of	1
scientific	1
warfare	1
that	1
are	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
jungle	1
folk	1
whereas	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
since	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
met	1
the	1
brute	1
rush	1
with	1
brute	1
force	1
he	1
now	1
sidestepped	1
his	1
antagonist	1
s	1
headlong	1
charge	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
brute	1
hurtled	1
past	1
him	1
swung	1
a	1
mighty	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
s	1
stomach	1
with	1
a	1
howl	1
of	1
mingled	1
rage	1
and	1
anguish	1
the	1
great	1
anthropoid	1
bent	1
double	1
and	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
though	1
almost	1
instantly	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
struggling	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
regain	1
them	1
however	1
his	1
white	1
skinned	1
foe	1
had	1
wheeled	1
and	1
pounced	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
there	1
dropped	1
from	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
english	1
lord	1
the	1
last	1
shred	1
of	1
his	1
superficial	1
mantle	1
of	1
civilization	1
once	1
again	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
jungle	1
beast	1
revelling	1
in	1
bloody	1
conflict	1
with	1
his	1
kind	1
once	1
again	1
he	1
was	1
tarzan	1
son	1
of	1
kala	1
the	1
she	1
ape	1
his	1
strong	1
white	1
teeth	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
hairy	1
throat	1
of	1
his	1
enemy	1
as	1
he	1
sought	1
the	1
pulsing	1
jugular	1
powerful	1
fingers	1
held	1
the	1
mighty	1
fangs	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
flesh	1
or	1
clenched	1
and	1
beat	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
steam	1
hammer	1
upon	1
the	1
snarling	1
foam	1
flecked	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
adversary	1
in	1
a	1
circle	1
about	1
them	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
apes	1
stood	1
watching	1
and	1
enjoying	1
the	1
struggle	1
they	1
muttered	1
low	1
gutturals	1
of	1
approval	1
as	1
bits	1
of	1
white	1
hide	1
or	1
hairy	1
bloodstained	1
skin	1
were	1
torn	1
from	1
one	1
contestant	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
silent	1
in	1
amazement	1
and	1
expectation	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
mighty	1
white	1
ape	1
wriggle	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
with	1
steel	1
muscles	1
tensed	1
beneath	1
the	1
armpits	1
of	1
his	1
antagonist	1
bear	1
down	1
mightily	1
with	1
his	1
open	1
palms	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
thick	1
bullneck	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
ape	1
could	1
but	1
shriek	1
in	1
agony	1
and	1
flounder	1
helplessly	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
thick	1
mat	1
of	1
jungle	1
grass	1
as	1
tarzan	1
had	1
overcome	1
the	1
huge	1
terkoz	1
that	1
time	1
years	1
before	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
about	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
upon	1
his	1
quest	1
for	1
human	1
beings	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
kind	1
and	1
colour	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
overcame	1
this	1
other	1
great	1
ape	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
wrestling	1
hold	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
stumbled	1
by	1
accident	1
during	1
that	1
other	1
combat	1
the	1
little	1
audience	1
of	1
fierce	1
anthropoids	1
heard	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
their	1
king	1
s	1
neck	1
mingling	1
with	1
his	1
agonized	1
shrieks	1
and	1
hideous	1
roaring	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sudden	1
crack	1
like	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
limb	1
before	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
the	1
bullet	1
head	1
crumpled	1
forward	1
upon	1
its	1
flaccid	1
neck	1
against	1
the	1
great	1
hairy	1
chest	1
the	1
roaring	1
and	1
the	1
shrieking	1
ceased	1
the	1
little	1
pig	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
onlookers	1
wandered	1
from	1
the	1
still	1
form	1
of	1
their	1
leader	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
ape	1
that	1
was	1
rising	1
to	1
its	1
feet	1
beside	1
the	1
vanquished	1
then	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
king	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
arise	1
and	1
slay	1
this	1
presumptuous	1
stranger	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
new	1
comer	1
place	1
a	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
figure	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
throwing	1
back	1
his	1
head	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
uncanny	1
challenge	1
of	1
the	1
bull	1
ape	1
that	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
kill	1
then	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
their	1
king	1
was	1
dead	1
across	1
the	1
jungle	1
rolled	1
the	1
horrid	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
cry	1
the	1
little	1
monkeys	1
in	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
ceased	1
their	1
chattering	1
the	1
harsh	1
voiced	1
brilliant	1
plumed	1
birds	1
were	1
still	1
from	1
afar	1
came	1
the	1
answering	1
wail	1
of	1
a	1
leopard	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
roar	1
of	1
a	1
lion	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
tarzan	1
who	1
turned	1
questioning	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
apes	1
before	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
old	1
tarzan	1
who	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
toss	1
back	1
a	1
heavy	1
mane	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
an	1
old	1
habit	1
dating	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
his	1
great	1
shock	1
of	1
thick	1
black	1
hair	1
had	1
fallen	1
about	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
often	1
tumbled	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
meant	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
vision	1
unobstructed	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
expect	1
an	1
immediate	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
particular	1
surviving	1
bull	1
ape	1
who	1
felt	1
himself	1
best	1
fitted	1
to	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
kingship	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
apes	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unusual	1
for	1
an	1
entire	1
stranger	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
community	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
dispatched	1
the	1
king	1
assume	1
the	1
leadership	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
himself	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
fallen	1
monarch	1
s	1
mates	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
if	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
they	1
might	1
move	1
slowly	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
later	1
to	1
fight	1
among	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
supremacy	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
king	1
of	1
them	1
if	1
he	1
so	1
chose	1
he	1
was	1
confident	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
he	1
cared	1
to	1
assume	1
the	1
sometimes	1
irksome	1
duties	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
particular	1
advantage	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
thereby	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
apes	1
a	1
huge	1
splendidly	1
muscled	1
brute	1
was	1
edging	1
threateningly	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
through	1
his	1
bared	1
fighting	1
fangs	1
there	1
issued	1
a	1
low	1
sullen	1
growl	1
tarzan	1
watched	1
his	1
every	1
move	1
standing	1
rigid	1
as	1
a	1
statue	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
back	1
a	1
step	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
precipitate	1
an	1
immediate	1
charge	1
to	1
have	1
rushed	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
other	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
result	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
put	1
the	1
bellicose	1
one	1
to	1
flight	1
it	1
all	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
young	1
bull	1
s	1
stock	1
of	1
courage	1
to	1
stand	1
perfectly	1
still	1
waiting	1
was	1
the	1
middle	1
course	1
in	1
this	1
event	1
the	1
bull	1
would	1
according	1
to	1
custom	1
approach	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
attention	1
growling	1
hideously	1
and	1
baring	1
slavering	1
fangs	1
slowly	1
he	1
would	1
circle	1
about	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
chip	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
even	1
as	1
tarzan	1
had	1
foreseen	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
bluff	1
royal	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
so	1
unstable	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
an	1
ape	1
a	1
passing	1
impulse	1
might	1
hurl	1
the	1
hairy	1
mass	1
tearing	1
and	1
rending	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
s	1
warning	1
as	1
the	1
brute	1
circled	1
him	1
tarzan	1
turned	1
slowly	1
keeping	1
his	1
eyes	1
ever	1
upon	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
antagonist	1
he	1
had	1
appraised	1
the	1
young	1
bull	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
quite	1
felt	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
overthrowing	1
his	1
former	1
king	1
but	1
who	1
one	1
day	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
tarzan	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
of	1
wondrous	1
proportions	1
standing	1
over	1
seven	1
feet	1
upon	1
his	1
short	1
bowed	1
legs	1
his	1
great	1
hairy	1
arms	1
reached	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
even	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
erect	1
and	1
his	1
fighting	1
fangs	1
now	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
tarzan	1
s	1
face	1
were	1
exceptionally	1
long	1
and	1
sharp	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
he	1
differed	1
in	1
several	1
minor	1
essentials	1
from	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
tarzan	1
s	1
boyhood	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
experienced	1
a	1
thrill	1
of	1
hope	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
shaggy	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoids	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
freak	1
of	1
fate	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
again	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
tribe	1
but	1
a	1
closer	1
inspection	1
had	1
convinced	1
him	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
another	1
species	1
as	1
the	1
threatening	1
bull	1
continued	1
his	1
stiff	1
and	1
jerky	1
circling	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
much	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
noted	1
among	1
dogs	1
when	1
a	1
strange	1
canine	1
comes	1
among	1
them	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
tarzan	1
to	1
discover	1
if	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
tribe	1
was	1
identical	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
this	1
other	1
family	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
brute	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
kerchak	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
who	1
threatens	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
the	1
hairy	1
brute	1
looked	1
his	1
surprise	1
i	1
am	1
akut	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
simple	1
primal	1
tongue	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
low	1
in	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
spoken	1
languages	1
that	1
as	1
tarzan	1
had	1
surmised	1
it	1
was	1
identical	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
first	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
spent	1
i	1
am	1
akut	1
said	1
the	1
ape	1
molak	1
is	1
dead	1
i	1
am	1
king	1
go	1
away	1
or	1
i	1
shall	1
kill	1
you	1
you	1
saw	1
how	1
easily	1
i	1
killed	1
molak	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
so	1
i	1
could	1
kill	1
you	1
if	1
i	1
cared	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
but	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
all	1
he	1
wishes	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
friends	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
can	1
help	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
help	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
you	1
cannot	1
kill	1
akut	1
replied	1
the	1
other	1
none	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
akut	1
had	1
you	1
not	1
killed	1
molak	1
akut	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
for	1
akut	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
for	1
answer	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
hurled	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
brute	1
who	1
during	1
the	1
conversation	1
had	1
slightly	1
relaxed	1
his	1
vigilance	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
seized	1
the	1
wrist	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
ape	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
could	1
grapple	1
with	1
him	1
had	1
whirled	1
him	1
about	1
and	1
leaped	1
upon	1
his	1
broad	1
back	1
down	1
they	1
went	1
together	1
but	1
so	1
well	1
had	1
tarzan	1
s	1
plan	1
worked	1
out	1
that	1
before	1
ever	1
they	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
same	1
hold	1
upon	1
akut	1
that	1
had	1
broken	1
molak	1
s	1
neck	1
slowly	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
pressure	1
to	1
bear	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
in	1
days	1
gone	1
by	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
kerchak	1
the	1
chance	1
to	1
surrender	1
and	1
live	1
so	1
now	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
akut	1
in	1
whom	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
possible	1
ally	1
of	1
great	1
strength	1
and	1
resource	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
amity	1
with	1
him	1
or	1
dying	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
seen	1
his	1
savage	1
and	1
heretofore	1
invincible	1
king	1
die	1
ka	1
goda	1
whispered	1
tarzan	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
beneath	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
question	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
whispered	1
to	1
kerchak	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
it	1
means	1
broadly	1
do	1
you	1
surrender	1
akut	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
creaking	1
sound	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
just	1
before	1
molak	1
s	1
thick	1
neck	1
had	1
snapped	1
and	1
he	1
shuddered	1
he	1
hated	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
kingship	1
though	1
so	1
again	1
he	1
struggled	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
but	1
a	1
sudden	1
torturing	1
pressure	1
upon	1
his	1
vertebra	1
brought	1
an	1
agonized	1
ka	1
goda	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1
tarzan	1
relaxed	1
his	1
grip	1
a	1
trifle	1
you	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
king	1
akut	1
he	1
said	1
tarzan	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
if	1
any	1
question	1
your	1
right	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
battles	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
rose	1
and	1
akut	1
came	1
slowly	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
shaking	1
his	1
bullet	1
head	1
and	1
growling	1
angrily	1
he	1
waddled	1
toward	1
his	1
tribe	1
looking	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
bulls	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
challenge	1
his	1
leadership	1
but	1
none	1
did	1
so	1
instead	1
they	1
drew	1
away	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
whole	1
pack	1
moved	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
and	1
tarzan	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
once	1
more	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
sore	1
from	1
the	1
wounds	1
that	1
molak	1
had	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
inured	1
to	1
physical	1
suffering	1
and	1
endured	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
calm	1
and	1
fortitude	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
that	1
had	1
taught	1
him	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
jungle	1
life	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
to	1
it	1
his	1
first	1
need	1
he	1
realized	1
was	1
for	1
weapons	1
of	1
offence	1
and	1
defence	1
for	1
his	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
apes	1
and	1
the	1
distant	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
voices	1
of	1
numa	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
warned	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
life	1
of	1
indolent	1
ease	1
and	1
security	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
existence	1
of	1
constant	1
bloodshed	1
and	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
hunting	1
and	1
the	1
being	1
hunted	1
grim	1
beasts	1
would	1
stalk	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
stalked	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
moment	1
by	1
savage	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
cruel	1
night	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
instant	1
need	1
of	1
such	1
crude	1
weapons	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
fashion	1
from	1
the	1
materials	1
at	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1
he	1
found	1
an	1
out	1
cropping	1
of	1
brittle	1
igneous	1
rock	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
much	1
labour	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
chip	1
off	1
a	1
narrow	1
sliver	1
some	1
twelve	1
inches	1
long	1
by	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
thick	1
one	1
edge	1
was	1
quite	1
thin	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
near	1
the	1
tip	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
rudiment	1
of	1
a	1
knife	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
searching	1
until	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
fallen	1
tree	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
species	1
of	1
hardwood	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
familiar	1
from	1
this	1
he	1
cut	1
a	1
small	1
straight	1
branch	1
which	1
he	1
pointed	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
then	1
he	1
scooped	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
prostrate	1
trunk	1
into	1
this	1
he	1
crumbled	1
a	1
few	1
bits	1
of	1
dry	1
bark	1
minutely	1
shredded	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
inserted	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
pointed	1
stick	1
and	1
sitting	1
astride	1
the	1
bole	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
spun	1
the	1
slender	1
rod	1
rapidly	1
between	1
his	1
palms	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
a	1
thin	1
smoke	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
mass	1
of	1
tinder	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
whole	1
broke	1
into	1
flame	1
heaping	1
some	1
larger	1
twigs	1
and	1
sticks	1
upon	1
the	1
tiny	1
fire	1
tarzan	1
soon	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
respectable	1
blaze	1
roaring	1
in	1
the	1
enlarging	1
cavity	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
tree	1
into	1
this	1
he	1
thrust	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
stone	1
knife	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
became	1
superheated	1
he	1
would	1
withdraw	1
it	1
touching	1
a	1
spot	1
near	1
the	1
thin	1
edge	1
with	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
moisture	1
beneath	1
the	1
wetted	1
area	1
a	1
little	1
flake	1
of	1
the	1
glassy	1
material	1
would	1
crack	1
and	1
scale	1
away	1
thus	1
very	1
slowly	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
commenced	1
the	1
tedious	1
operation	1
of	1
putting	1
a	1
thin	1
edge	1
upon	1
his	1
primitive	1
hunting	1
knife	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
feat	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
sitting	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
achieve	1
a	1
cutting	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
inches	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
cut	1
a	1
long	1
pliable	1
bow	1
a	1
handle	1
for	1
his	1
knife	1
a	1
stout	1
cudgel	1
and	1
a	1
goodly	1
supply	1
of	1
arrows	1
these	1
he	1
cached	1
in	1
a	1
tall	1
tree	1
beside	1
a	1
little	1
stream	1
and	1
here	1
also	1
he	1
constructed	1
a	1
platform	1
with	1
a	1
roof	1
of	1
palm	1
leaves	1
above	1
it	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
finished	1
it	1
was	1
growing	1
dusk	1
and	1
tarzan	1
felt	1
a	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
eat	1
he	1
had	1
noted	1
during	1
the	1
brief	1
incursion	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
that	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
up	1
stream	1
from	1
his	1
tree	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
much	1
used	1
watering	1
place	1
where	1
from	1
the	1
trampled	1
mud	1
of	1
either	1
bank	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
beasts	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
numbers	1
came	1
to	1
drink	1
to	1
this	1
spot	1
the	1
hungry	1
ape	1
man	1
made	1
his	1
silent	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
terrace	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
he	1
swung	1
with	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
a	1
monkey	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
heavy	1
burden	1
upon	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
in	1
this	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
free	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
boyhood	1
yet	1
even	1
with	1
that	1
burden	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
habits	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
life	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
reality	1
more	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
thin	1
veneer	1
of	1
civilization	1
that	1
the	1
past	1
three	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
association	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
world	1
had	1
spread	1
lightly	1
over	1
him	1
a	1
veneer	1
that	1
only	1
hid	1
the	1
crudities	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
been	1
could	1
his	1
fellow	1
peers	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
lords	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
then	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
held	1
up	1
their	1
noble	1
hands	1
in	1
holy	1
horror	1
silently	1
he	1
crouched	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
forest	1
giant	1
that	1
overhung	1
the	1
trail	1
his	1
keen	1
eyes	1
and	1
sensitive	1
ears	1
strained	1
into	1
the	1
distant	1
jungle	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
his	1
dinner	1
would	1
presently	1
emerge	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
long	1
to	1
wait	1
scarce	1
had	1
he	1
settled	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
comfortable	1
position	1
his	1
lithe	1
muscular	1
legs	1
drawn	1
well	1
up	1
beneath	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
panther	1
draws	1
his	1
hindquarters	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
the	1
spring	1
than	1
bara	1
the	1
deer	1
came	1
daintily	1
down	1
to	1
drink	1
but	1
more	1
than	1
bara	1
was	1
coming	1
behind	1
the	1
graceful	1
buck	1
came	1
another	1
which	1
the	1
deer	1
could	1
neither	1
see	1
nor	1
scent	1
but	1
whose	1
movements	1
were	1
apparent	1
to	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
elevated	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
ambush	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
yet	1
exactly	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
moved	1
so	1
stealthily	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
behind	1
the	1
deer	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
beast	1
of	1
prey	1
stalking	1
bara	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
purpose	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
await	1
the	1
fleet	1
animal	1
numa	1
perhaps	1
or	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
in	1
any	1
event	1
tarzan	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
repast	1
slipping	1
from	1
his	1
grasp	1
unless	1
bara	1
moved	1
more	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
the	1
ford	1
than	1
at	1
present	1
even	1
as	1
these	1
thoughts	1
passed	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
some	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
stalker	1
in	1
his	1
rear	1
must	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
buck	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
start	1
he	1
paused	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
trembling	1
in	1
his	1
tracks	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
swift	1
bound	1
dashed	1
straight	1
for	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
tarzan	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
flee	1
through	1
the	1
shallow	1
ford	1
and	1
escape	1
upon	1

see	1
him	1
quite	1
plainly	1
now	1
below	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
bara	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
pass	1
could	1
he	1
do	1
it	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
the	1
question	1
the	1
hungry	1
man	1
launched	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
perch	1
full	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
startled	1
buck	1
in	1
another	1
instant	1
numa	1
would	1
be	1
upon	1
them	1
both	1
so	1
if	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
were	1
to	1
dine	1
that	1
night	1
or	1
ever	1
again	1
he	1
must	1
act	1
quickly	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
sleek	1
hide	1
of	1
the	1
deer	1
with	1
a	1
momentum	1
that	1
sent	1
the	1
animal	1
to	1
its	1
knees	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
grasped	1
a	1
horn	1
in	1
either	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
quick	1
wrench	1
twisted	1
the	1
animal	1
s	1
neck	1
completely	1
round	1
until	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
vertebrae	1
snap	1
beneath	1
his	1
grip	1
the	1
lion	1
was	1
roaring	1
in	1
rage	1
close	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
swung	1
the	1
deer	1
across	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
grasping	1
a	1
foreleg	1
between	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
leaped	1
for	1
the	1
nearest	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
branches	1
that	1
swung	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
he	1
grasped	1
the	1
limb	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
numa	1
sprang	1
drew	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
prey	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
s	1
cruel	1
talons	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
thud	1
below	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
baffled	1
cat	1
fell	1
back	1
to	1
earth	1
and	1
then	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1

drawing	1
his	1
dinner	1
farther	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
limb	1
looked	1
down	1
with	1
grinning	1
face	1
into	1
the	1
gleaming	1
yellow	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
wild	1
beast	1
that	1
glared	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
beneath	1
and	1
with	1
taunting	1
insults	1
flaunted	1
the	1
tender	1
carcass	1
of	1
his	1
kill	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
cheated	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
crude	1
stone	1
knife	1
he	1
cut	1
a	1
juicy	1
steak	1
from	1

forth	1
below	1

nor	1
ever	1
in	1

of	1

a	1
meal	1
tasted	1
more	1
palatable	1
the	1
warm	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
kill	1
smeared	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1

and	1
filled	1
his	1
nostrils	1
with	1
the	1
scent	1
that	1
the	1
savage	1
carnivora	1
love	1
best	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
carcass	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
fork	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
dined	1
and	1
with	1
numa	1
trailing	1
below	1
him	1
still	1
keen	1
for	1
revenge	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
tree	1

where	1
he	1
slept	1
until	1
the	1

was	1
high	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1

sheeta	1
the	1
next	1
few	1
days	1
were	1
occupied	1
by	1
tarzan	1
in	1
completing	1
his	1
weapons	1
and	1
exploring	1
the	1
jungle	1
he	1
strung	1
his	1
bow	1
with	1
tendons	1
from	1
the	1
buck	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
dined	1
his	1
first	1
evening	1
upon	1
the	1
new	1
shore	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
the	1
gut	1
of	1
sheeta	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
he	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
wait	1
until	1
opportunity	1
permitted	1
him	1
to	1
kill	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cats	1
he	1
also	1
braided	1
a	1
long	1
grass	1
rope	1
such	1
a	1
rope	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
before	1
to	1
tantalize	1
the	1
ill	1
natured	1
tublat	1
and	1
which	1
later	1
had	1
developed	1
into	1
a	1
wondrous	1
effective	1
weapon	1
in	1
the	1
practised	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
ape	1
boy	1
a	1
sheath	1
and	1
handle	1
for	1
his	1
hunting	1
knife	1
he	1
fashioned	1
and	1
a	1
quiver	1
for	1
arrows	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hide	1
of	1
bara	1
a	1
belt	1
and	1
loin	1
cloth	1
then	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
learn	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
land	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
old	1
familiar	1
west	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
african	1
continent	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
faced	1
east	1
the	1
rising	1
sun	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
before	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
east	1
coast	1
of	1
africa	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
positive	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
satisfied	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
had	1
not	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
mediterranean	1
the	1
suez	1
canal	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
sea	1
nor	1
had	1
she	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
round	1
the	1
cape	1
of	1
good	1
hope	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
sometimes	1
he	1
wondered	1
if	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
broad	1
atlantic	1
to	1
deposit	1
him	1
upon	1
some	1
wild	1
south	1
american	1
shore	1
but	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
numa	1
the	1
lion	1
decided	1
him	1
that	1
such	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
as	1
tarzan	1
made	1
his	1
lonely	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
paralleling	1
the	1
shore	1
he	1
felt	1
strong	1
upon	1
him	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
companionship	1
so	1
that	1
gradually	1
he	1
commenced	1
to	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
cast	1
his	1
lot	1
with	1
the	1
apes	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
them	1
since	1
that	1
first	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
influences	1
of	1
civilization	1
were	1
still	1
paramount	1
within	1
him	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
nearly	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
tarzan	1
of	1
old	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
appreciated	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
little	1
in	1
common	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
anthropoids	1
still	1
they	1
were	1
better	1
than	1
no	1
company	1
at	1
all	1
moving	1
leisurely	1
sometimes	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
lower	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
gathering	1
an	1
occasional	1
fruit	1
or	1
turning	1
over	1
a	1
fallen	1
log	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
bugs	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
found	1
as	1
palatable	1
as	1
of	1
old	1
tarzan	1
had	1
covered	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
more	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
sheeta	1
up	1
wind	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
now	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
was	1
one	1
whom	1
tarzan	1
was	1
exceptionally	1
glad	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
mind	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
utilize	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
s	1
strong	1
gut	1
for	1
his	1
bow	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
fashion	1
a	1
new	1
quiver	1
and	1
loin	1
cloth	1
from	1
pieces	1
of	1
his	1
hide	1
so	1
whereas	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
gone	1
carelessly	1
before	1
he	1
now	1
became	1
the	1
personification	1
of	1
noiseless	1
stealth	1
swiftly	1
and	1
silently	1
he	1
glided	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
cat	1
nor	1
was	1
the	1
pursuer	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
noble	1
birth	1
one	1
whit	1
less	1
savage	1
than	1
the	1
wild	1
fierce	1
thing	1
he	1
stalked	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
closer	1
to	1
sheeta	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
panther	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
stalking	1
game	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
realized	1
this	1
fact	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
nostrils	1
wafted	1
from	1
his	1
right	1
by	1
a	1
vagrant	1
breeze	1
the	1
strong	1
odour	1
of	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
great	1
apes	1
the	1
panther	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
tree	1
as	1
tarzan	1
came	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
beyond	1
and	1
below	1
him	1
tarzan	1
saw	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
lolling	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
natural	1
clearing	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
dozing	1
against	1
the	1
boles	1
of	1
trees	1
while	1
others	1
roamed	1
about	1
turning	1
over	1
bits	1
of	1
bark	1
from	1
beneath	1
which	1
they	1
transferred	1
the	1
luscious	1
grubs	1
and	1
beetles	1
to	1
their	1
mouths	1
akut	1
was	1
the	1
closest	1
to	1
sheeta	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
lay	1
crouched	1
upon	1
a	1
thick	1
limb	1
hidden	1
from	1
the	1
ape	1
s	1
view	1
by	1
dense	1
foliage	1
waiting	1
patiently	1
until	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
should	1
come	1
within	1
range	1
of	1
his	1
spring	1
tarzan	1
cautiously	1
gained	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tree	1
with	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
grasped	1
his	1
slim	1
stone	1
blade	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
noose	1
but	1
the	1
foliage	1
surrounding	1
the	1
huge	1
cat	1
precluded	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
an	1
accurate	1
throw	1
with	1
the	1
rope	1
akut	1
had	1
now	1
wandered	1
quite	1
close	1
beneath	1
the	1
tree	1
wherein	1
lay	1
the	1
waiting	1
death	1
sheeta	1
slowly	1
edged	1
his	1
hind	1
paws	1
along	1
the	1
branch	1
still	1
further	1
beneath	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
hideous	1
shriek	1
he	1
launched	1
himself	1
toward	1
the	1
great	1
ape	1
the	1
barest	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
before	1
his	1
spring	1
another	1
beast	1
of	1
prey	1
above	1
him	1
leaped	1
its	1
weird	1
and	1
savage	1
cry	1
mingling	1
with	1
his	1
as	1
the	1
startled	1
akut	1
looked	1
up	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
panther	1
almost	1
above	1
him	1
and	1
already	1
upon	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
back	1
the	1
white	1
ape	1
that	1
had	1
bested	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
near	1
the	1
great	1
water	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
were	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
sheeta	1
s	1
neck	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
arm	1
was	1
round	1
the	1
fierce	1
throat	1
while	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
grasping	1
a	1
slender	1
piece	1
of	1
stone	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
mighty	1
blows	1
upon	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
side	1
behind	1
the	1
left	1
shoulder	1
akut	1
had	1
just	1
time	1
to	1
leap	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
pinioned	1
beneath	1
these	1
battling	1
monsters	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
a	1
crash	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
earth	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
sheeta	1
was	1
screaming	1
snarling	1
and	1
roaring	1
horribly	1
but	1
the	1
white	1
ape	1
clung	1
tenaciously	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
the	1
thrashing	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
quarry	1
steadily	1
and	1
remorselessly	1
the	1
stone	1
knife	1
was	1
driven	1
home	1
through	1
the	1
glossy	1
hide	1
time	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
drank	1
deep	1
until	1
with	1
a	1
final	1
agonized	1
lunge	1
and	1
shriek	1
the	1
great	1
feline	1
rolled	1
over	1
upon	1
its	1
side	1
and	1
save	1
for	1
the	1
spasmodic	1
jerking	1
of	1
its	1
muscles	1
lay	1
quiet	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
death	1
then	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
carcass	1
of	1
his	1
kill	1
and	1
once	1
again	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
rang	1
his	1
wild	1
and	1
savage	1
victory	1
challenge	1
akut	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
stood	1
looking	1
in	1
startled	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
lithe	1
straight	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
slain	1
him	1
tarzan	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak	1
he	1
had	1
saved	1
akut	1
s	1
life	1
for	1
a	1
purpose	1
and	1
knowing	1
the	1
limitations	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
intellect	1
he	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
this	1
purpose	1
plain	1
to	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
hoped	1
i	1
am	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
he	1
said	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
mighty	1
fighter	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
water	1
i	1
spared	1
akut	1
s	1
life	1
when	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
and	1
become	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
now	1
i	1
have	1
saved	1
akut	1
from	1
death	1
beneath	1
the	1
rending	1
fangs	1
of	1
sheeta	1
when	1
akut	1
or	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
let	1
them	1
call	1
to	1
tarzan	1
thus	1
and	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
raised	1
the	1
hideous	1
cry	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
kerchak	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
summon	1
its	1
absent	1
members	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
peril	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
tarzan	1
call	1
to	1
them	1
let	1
them	1
remember	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
akut	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
speed	1
shall	1

assented	1
akut	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
there	1
rose	1
a	1
unanimous	1
huh	1
then	1
presently	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
feeding	1
again	1

nothing	1

lord	1
greystoke	1
he	1
noticed	1
however	1
that	1
akut	1
kept	1
always	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
often	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
wonder	1
in	1
his	1
little	1
bloodshot	1
eyes	1
and	1
once	1
he	1
did	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
tarzan	1
during	1
all	1
his	1
long	1
years	1
among	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
an	1
ape	1
do	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
particularly	1
tender	1
morsel	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
tarzan	1
as	1
the	1
tribe	1
hunted	1
the	1
glistening	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
brown	1
shaggy	1
hides	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
oftentimes	1
they	1
brushed	1
together	1
in	1
passing	1
but	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
his	1
presence	1
for	1
granted	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
akut	1
himself	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
too	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
baby	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
bare	1
her	1
great	1
fighting	1
fangs	1
and	1
growl	1
ominously	1
and	1
occasionally	1
a	1
truculent	1
young	1
bull	1
would	1
snarl	1
a	1
warning	1
if	1
tarzan	1
approached	1
while	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
eating	1
but	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
the	1
treatment	1
was	1
no	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
accorded	1
any	1
other	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
tarzan	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
felt	1
very	1
much	1
at	1
home	1
with	1
these	1
fierce	1
hairy	1
progenitors	1
of	1
primitive	1
man	1
he	1
skipped	1
nimbly	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
of	1
each	1
threatening	1
female	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
apes	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
occasional	1
fits	1
of	1
bestial	1
rage	1
and	1
he	1
growled	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
truculent	1
young	1
bulls	1
baring	1
his	1
canine	1
teeth	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
thus	1
easily	1
he	1
fell	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
early	1
life	1
nor	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
tasted	1
association	1
with	1
creatures	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
kind	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
week	1
he	1
roamed	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
his	1
new	1
friends	1
partly	1
because	1
of	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
companionship	1
and	1
partially	1
through	1
a	1
well	1
laid	1
plan	1
to	1
impress	1
himself	1
indelibly	1
upon	1
their	1
memories	1
which	1
at	1
best	1
are	1
none	1
too	1
long	1
for	1
tarzan	1
from	1
past	1
experience	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
stead	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
tribe	1
of	1
these	1
powerful	1
and	1
terrible	1
beasts	1
at	1
his	1
call	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
succeeded	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
in	1
fixing	1
his	1
identity	1
upon	1
them	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
again	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
exploration	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
early	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
keeping	1
parallel	1
with	1
the	1
shore	1
travelled	1
rapidly	1
until	1
almost	1
nightfall	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
lay	1
almost	1
directly	1
to	1
his	1
right	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
instead	1
of	1
straight	1
out	1
across	1
the	1
water	1
as	1
heretofore	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
reasoned	1
that	1
the	1
shore	1
line	1
had	1
trended	1
toward	1
the	1
west	1
all	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
he	1
continued	1
his	1
rapid	1
course	1
and	1
when	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
sought	1
speed	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
middle	1
terrace	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
a	1
squirrel	1
that	1
night	1
the	1
sun	1
set	1
straight	1
out	1
across	1
the	1
water	1
opposite	1
the	1
land	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
guessed	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
suspecting	1
rokoff	1
had	1
set	1
him	1
ashore	1
upon	1
an	1
island	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
it	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
plan	1
that	1
would	1
render	1
his	1
position	1
more	1
harrowing	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
such	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
lifetime	1
of	1
suspense	1
upon	1
an	1
uninhabited	1
island	1
rokoff	1
doubtless	1
had	1
sailed	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
mainland	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
comparatively	1
easy	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
delivering	1
the	1
infant	1
jack	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
cruel	1
and	1
savage	1
foster	1
parents	1
who	1
as	1
his	1
note	1
had	1
threatened	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
upbringing	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
tarzan	1
shuddered	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
cruel	1
suffering	1
the	1
little	1
one	1
must	1
endure	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
individuals	1
whose	1
intentions	1
toward	1
him	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kindest	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
had	1
sufficient	1
experience	1
with	1
the	1
lower	1
savages	1
of	1
africa	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
even	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
cruder	1
virtues	1
of	1
charity	1
and	1
humanity	1
but	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
at	1
best	1
but	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
terrible	1
privations	1
dangers	1
and	1
sufferings	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
horrid	1
after	1
fate	1
that	1
awaited	1
the	1
child	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
to	1
manhood	1
the	1
horrible	1
practices	1
that	1
would	1
form	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
training	1
would	1
alone	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
bar	1
him	1
forever	1
from	1
association	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
race	1
and	1
station	1
in	1
life	1
a	1
cannibal	1
his	1
little	1
boy	1
a	1
savage	1
man	1
eater	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
horrible	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
filed	1
teeth	1
the	1
slit	1
nose	1
the	1
little	1
face	1
painted	1
hideously	1
tarzan	1
groaned	1
could	1
he	1
but	1
feel	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
the	1
russ	1
fiend	1
beneath	1
his	1
steel	1
fingers	1
and	1
jane	1
what	1
tortures	1
of	1
doubt	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
uncertainty	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
suffering	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
position	1
was	1
infinitely	1
less	1
terrible	1
than	1
hers	1
for	1
he	1
at	1
least	1
knew	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
loved	1
ones	1
was	1
safe	1
at	1
home	1
while	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
either	1
her	1
husband	1
or	1
her	1
son	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
for	1
tarzan	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
guess	1
the	1
truth	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
would	1
have	1
but	1
added	1
a	1
hundredfold	1
to	1
his	1
suffering	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
slowly	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
his	1
mind	1
absorbed	1
by	1
his	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
there	1
presently	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
ears	1
a	1
strange	1
scratching	1
sound	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
translate	1
cautiously	1
he	1
moved	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
emanated	1
presently	1
coming	1
upon	1
a	1
huge	1
panther	1
pinned	1
beneath	1
a	1
fallen	1
tree	1
as	1
tarzan	1
approached	1
the	1
beast	1
turned	1
snarling	1
toward	1
him	1
struggling	1
to	1
extricate	1
itself	1
but	1
one	1
great	1
limb	1
across	1
its	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
entangling	1
branches	1
pinioning	1
its	1
legs	1
prevented	1
it	1
from	1
moving	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
in	1
any	1
direction	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
helpless	1
cat	1
fitting	1
an	1
arrow	1
to	1
his	1
bow	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
dispatch	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
otherwise	1
must	1
die	1
of	1
starvation	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
the	1
shaft	1
a	1
sudden	1
whim	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand	1
why	1
rob	1
the	1
poor	1
creature	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
liberty	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
easy	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
restore	1
both	1
to	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
panther	1
moved	1
all	1
its	1
limbs	1
in	1
its	1
futile	1
struggle	1
for	1
freedom	1
that	1
its	1
spine	1
was	1
uninjured	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
limbs	1
were	1
broken	1
relaxing	1
his	1
bowstring	1
he	1
returned	1
the	1
arrow	1
to	1
the	1
quiver	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
bow	1
about	1
his	1
shoulder	1
stepped	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
pinioned	1
beast	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
was	1
the	1
soothing	1
purring	1
sound	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
cats	1
themselves	1
made	1
when	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
nearest	1
approach	1
to	1
a	1
friendly	1
advance	1
that	1
tarzan	1
could	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
ceased	1
his	1
snarling	1
and	1
eyed	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
closely	1
to	1
lift	1
the	1
tree	1
s	1
great	1
weight	1
from	1
the	1
animal	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
come	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
those	1
long	1
strong	1
talons	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
tree	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
be	1
totally	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
beast	1
but	1
to	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
fear	1
was	1
a	1
thing	1
unknown	1
having	1
decided	1
he	1
acted	1
promptly	1
unhesitatingly	1
he	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
tangle	1
of	1
branches	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
side	1
still	1
voicing	1
his	1
friendly	1
and	1
conciliatory	1
purr	1
the	1
cat	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
man	1
eyeing	1
him	1
steadily	1
questioningly	1
the	1
long	1
fangs	1
were	1
bared	1
but	1
more	1
in	1
preparedness	1
than	1
threat	1
tarzan	1
put	1
a	1
broad	1
shoulder	1
beneath	1
the	1
bole	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
his	1
bare	1
leg	1
pressed	1
against	1
the	1
cat	1
s	1
silken	1
side	1
so	1
close	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
beast	1
slowly	1
tarzan	1
extended	1
his	1
giant	1
thews	1
the	1
great	1
tree	1
with	1
its	1
entangling	1
branches	1
rose	1
gradually	1
from	1
the	1
panther	1
who	1
feeling	1
the	1
encumbering	1
weight	1
diminish	1
quickly	1
crawled	1
from	1
beneath	1
tarzan	1
let	1
the	1
tree	1
fall	1
back	1
to	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
beasts	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
one	1
another	1
a	1
grim	1
smile	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
lips	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
free	1
this	1
savage	1
jungle	1
fellow	1
nor	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
surprised	1
him	1
had	1
the	1
cat	1
sprung	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
released	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
instead	1
it	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
watching	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
clamber	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
maze	1
of	1
fallen	1
branches	1
once	1
outside	1
tarzan	1
was	1
not	1
three	1
paces	1
from	1
the	1
panther	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
for	1
sheeta	1
cannot	1
climb	1
to	1
the	1
heights	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
can	1
go	1
but	1
something	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
bravado	1
perhaps	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
panther	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
discover	1
if	1
any	1
feeling	1
of	1
gratitude	1
would	1
prompt	1
the	1
beast	1
to	1
friendliness	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
mighty	1
cat	1
the	1
creature	1
stepped	1
warily	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
brushed	1
past	1
him	1
within	1
a	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
dripping	1
jaws	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
continued	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
forest	1
the	1
panther	1
followed	1
on	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
hound	1
follows	1
at	1
heel	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whether	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
following	1
out	1
of	1
friendly	1
feelings	1
or	1
merely	1
stalking	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
hungry	1
but	1
finally	1
he	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
incentive	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
prompted	1
the	1
animal	1
s	1
action	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
a	1
deer	1
sent	1
tarzan	1
into	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
his	1
noose	1
about	1
the	1
animal	1
s	1
neck	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
sheeta	1
using	1
a	1
purr	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
utilized	1
to	1
pacify	1
the	1
brute	1
s	1
suspicions	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
but	1
a	1
trifle	1
louder	1
and	1
more	1
shrill	1
it	1
was	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1

a	1
kill	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
hunting	1
in	1
pairs	1
almost	1
immediately	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
crashing	1
of	1
the	1
underbrush	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
lithe	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
strange	1
companion	1
broke	1
into	1
view	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
bara	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
blood	1
the	1
panther	1
gave	1
forth	1
a	1
shrill	1
scream	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
two	1
beasts	1
were	1
feeding	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
upon	1
the	1
tender	1
meat	1
of	1
the	1
deer	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
this	1
strangely	1
assorted	1
pair	1
roamed	1
the	1
jungle	1
together	1
when	1
one	1
made	1
a	1
kill	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
fed	1
well	1
and	1
often	1
on	1
one	1
occasion	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
dining	1
upon	1
the	1
carcass	1
of	1
a	1
boar	1
that	1
sheeta	1
had	1
dispatched	1

and	1
terrible	1
broke	1
through	1
the	1
tangled	1
grasses	1
close	1
beside	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
warning	1
roar	1
he	1
sprang	1
forward	1
to	1
chase	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
kill	1
sheeta	1
bounded	1
into	1
a	1
near	1
by	1
thicket	1
while	1
tarzan	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
low	1
branches	1
of	1
an	1
overhanging	1
tree	1
here	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
unloosed	1
his	1
grass	1
rope	1
from	1
about	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
as	1
numa	1
stood	1
above	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
boar	1
challenging	1
head	1
erect	1
he	1
dropped	1
the	1
sinuous	1
noose	1
about	1
the	1
maned	1
neck	1
drawing	1
the	1
stout	1
strands	1
taut	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
jerk	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
called	1
shrilly	1
to	1
sheeta	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
struggling	1
lion	1
upward	1
until	1
only	1
his	1
hind	1
feet	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
quickly	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
rope	1
fast	1
to	1
a	1
stout	1
branch	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
panther	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
summons	1
leaped	1
into	1
sight	1
tarzan	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
beside	1
the	1
struggling	1
and	1
infuriated	1
numa	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
sharp	1
knife	1
sprang	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
even	1
as	1
sheeta	1
did	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
panther	1
tore	1
and	1
rent	1
numa	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
while	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
struck	1
home	1
with	1
his	1
stone	1
knife	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
so	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
mighty	1
clawing	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
beasts	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
parting	1
the	1
rope	1
he	1
hung	1
quite	1
dead	1
and	1
harmless	1
in	1
the	1
noose	1
and	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
jungle	1
air	1
there	1
rose	1
in	1
unison	1
from	1
two	1
savage	1
throats	1
the	1
victory	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
bull	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
panther	1
blended	1
into	1
one	1
frightful	1
and	1
uncanny	1
scream	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
notes	1
died	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
drawn	1
fearsome	1
wail	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
painted	1
warriors	1
drawing	1
their	1

mugambi	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
tarzan	1
had	1
travelled	1
entirely	1
about	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
and	1
made	1
several	1
trips	1
inland	1
from	1
various	1
points	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
human	1
being	1
upon	1
it	1
nowhere	1
had	1
he	1
found	1
any	1
sign	1
that	1
men	1
had	1
stopped	1
even	1
temporarily	1
upon	1
this	1
shore	1
though	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
so	1
quickly	1
does	1
the	1
rank	1

of	1
the	1
tropics	1
erase	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
permanent	1
of	1
human	1
monuments	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
error	1
in	1
his	1
deductions	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
numa	1
tarzan	1
and	1
sheeta	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
the	1
great	1
apes	1
took	1
to	1
flight	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
tarzan	1
succeeded	1
in	1
recalling	1
them	1
it	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
interesting	1
experiment	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
reconcile	1
these	1
hereditary	1
enemies	1
he	1
welcomed	1
anything	1
that	1
would	1
occupy	1
his	1
time	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
beyond	1
the	1
filling	1
of	1
his	1
belly	1
and	1
the	1
gloomy	1
thoughts	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
fell	1
prey	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
idle	1
to	1
communicate	1
his	1
plan	1
to	1
the	1
apes	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
particularly	1
difficult	1
matter	1
though	1
their	1
narrow	1
and	1
limited	1
vocabulary	1
was	1
strained	1
in	1
the	1
effort	1
but	1
to	1
impress	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
wicked	1
brain	1
of	1
sheeta	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
hunt	1
with	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
legitimate	1
prey	1
proved	1
a	1
task	1
almost	1
beyond	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
tarzan	1
among	1
his	1
other	1
weapons	1
possessed	1
a	1
long	1
stout	1
cudgel	1
and	1
after	1
fastening	1
his	1
rope	1
about	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
neck	1
he	1
used	1
this	1
instrument	1
freely	1
upon	1
the	1
snarling	1
beast	1
endeavouring	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
to	1
impress	1
upon	1
its	1
memory	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
attack	1
the	1
great	1
shaggy	1
manlike	1
creatures	1
that	1
had	1
approached	1
more	1
closely	1
once	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
about	1
sheeta	1
s	1
neck	1
that	1
the	1
cat	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
and	1
rend	1
tarzan	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
miracle	1
which	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
twice	1
when	1
it	1
turned	1
growling	1
upon	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
rapped	1
it	1
sharply	1
upon	1
its	1
sensitive	1
nose	1
inculcating	1
in	1
its	1
mind	1
thereby	1
a	1
most	1
wholesome	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
cudgel	1
and	1
the	1
ape	1
beasts	1
behind	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
if	1
the	1
original	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
attachment	1
for	1
tarzan	1
was	1
still	1
at	1
all	1
clear	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
though	1
doubtless	1
some	1
subconscious	1
suggestion	1
superinduced	1
by	1
this	1
primary	1
reason	1
and	1
aided	1
and	1
abetted	1
by	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
few	1
days	1
did	1
much	1
to	1
compel	1
the	1
beast	1
to	1
tolerate	1
treatment	1
at	1
his	1
hands	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
sent	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
creature	1
then	1
too	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
compelling	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
manmind	1
exerting	1
its	1
powerful	1
influence	1
over	1
this	1
creature	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
order	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
this	1
that	1
proved	1
the	1
most	1
potent	1
factor	1
in	1
tarzan	1
s	1
supremacy	1
over	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
that	1
had	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
fallen	1
under	1
his	1
domination	1
be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
for	1
days	1
the	1
man	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
apes	1
roamed	1
their	1
savage	1
haunts	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
making	1
their	1
kills	1
together	1
and	1
sharing	1
them	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
fierce	1
and	1
savage	1
band	1
none	1
was	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
the	1
smooth	1
skinned	1
powerful	1
beast	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
short	1
months	1
before	1
a	1
familiar	1
figure	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
london	1
drawing	1
room	1
sometimes	1
the	1
beasts	1
separated	1
to	1
follow	1
their	1
own	1
inclinations	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
occasions	1
when	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
wandered	1
through	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
toward	1
the	1
beach	1
and	1
was	1
stretched	1
in	1
the	1
hot	1
sun	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
low	1
summit	1
of	1
a	1
near	1
by	1
promontory	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
keen	1
eyes	1
discovered	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
looked	1
in	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
white	1
man	1
basking	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
that	1
hot	1
tropic	1
sun	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
making	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
behind	1
him	1
presently	1
another	1
pair	1
of	1
eyes	1
were	1
looking	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
and	1
another	1
until	1
a	1
full	1
score	1
of	1
hideously	1
trapped	1
savage	1
warriors	1
were	1
lying	1
upon	1
their	1
bellies	1
along	1
the	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
ridge	1
watching	1
the	1
white	1
skinned	1
stranger	1
they	1
were	1
down	1
wind	1
from	1
tarzan	1
and	1
so	1
their	1
scent	1
was	1
not	1
carried	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
back	1
was	1
turned	1
half	1
toward	1
them	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
their	1
cautious	1
advance	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
promontory	1
and	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
rank	1
grass	1
toward	1
the	1
sandy	1
beach	1
where	1
he	1
lay	1
big	1
fellows	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
their	1
barbaric	1
headdresses	1
and	1
grotesquely	1
painted	1
faces	1
together	1
with	1
their	1
many	1
metal	1
ornaments	1
and	1
gorgeously	1
coloured	1
feathers	1
adding	1
to	1
their	1
wild	1
fierce	1
appearance	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
ridge	1
they	1
came	1
cautiously	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
and	1
bent	1
half	1
double	1
advanced	1
silently	1
upon	1
the	1
unconscious	1
white	1
man	1
their	1
heavy	1
war	1
clubs	1
swinging	1
menacingly	1
in	1
their	1
brawny	1
hands	1
the	1
mental	1
suffering	1
that	1
tarzan	1
s	1
sorrowful	1
thoughts	1
induced	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
numbing	1
his	1
keen	1
perceptive	1
faculties	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
advancing	1
savages	1
were	1
almost	1
upon	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
alone	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
so	1
quickly	1
though	1
were	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
muscles	1
wont	1
to	1
react	1
in	1
unison	1
to	1
the	1
slightest	1
alarm	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
facing	1
his	1
enemies	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
behind	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
the	1
warriors	1
leaped	1
toward	1
him	1
with	1
raised	1
clubs	1
and	1
savage	1
yells	1
but	1
the	1
foremost	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
sudden	1
death	1
beneath	1
the	1
long	1
stout	1
stick	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
lithe	1
sinewy	1
figure	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
striking	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
fury	1
power	1
and	1
precision	1
that	1
brought	1
panic	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
blacks	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
withdrew	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
consulted	1
together	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
with	1
folded	1
arms	1
a	1
half	1
smile	1
upon	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
watching	1
them	1
presently	1
they	1
advanced	1
upon	1
him	1
once	1
more	1
this	1
time	1
wielding	1
their	1
heavy	1
war	1
spears	1
they	1
were	1
between	1
tarzan	1
and	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
semicircle	1
that	1
closed	1
in	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
advanced	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
but	1
slight	1
chance	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
final	1
charge	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
spears	1
should	1
be	1
hurled	1
simultaneously	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
desired	1
to	1
escape	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
other	1
than	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
except	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
behind	1
him	1
his	1
predicament	1
was	1
indeed	1
most	1
serious	1
when	1
an	1
idea	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
altered	1
his	1
smile	1
to	1
a	1
broad	1
grin	1
the	1
warriors	1
were	1
still	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
away	1
advancing	1
slowly	1
making	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
kind	1
a	1
frightful	1
din	1
with	1
their	1
savage	1
yells	1
and	1
the	1
pounding	1
of	1
their	1
naked	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
they	1
leaped	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
fantastic	1
war	1
dance	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
lifted	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
wild	1
weird	1
screams	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
blacks	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
perplexed	1
halt	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
questioningly	1
for	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
so	1
hideous	1
that	1
their	1
own	1
frightful	1
din	1
faded	1
into	1
insignificance	1
beside	1
it	1
no	1
human	1
throat	1
could	1
have	1
formed	1
those	1
bestial	1
notes	1
they	1
were	1
sure	1
and	1
yet	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
eyes	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
this	1
white	1
man	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
pour	1
forth	1
his	1
awful	1
cry	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
hesitated	1
and	1
then	1
with	1

even	1
then	1
a	1
sudden	1
crashing	1
in	1
the	1

them	1
once	1

frozen	1
the	1

from	1

a	1

panther	1
with	1
blazing	1

bared	1

in	1

a	1

lumbering	1
rapidly	1
toward	1

half	1

upon	1

short	1

with	1
their	1

reaching	1
to	1

their	1
horny	1
knuckles	1
bore	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
their	1
ponderous	1
bodies	1
as	1
they	1
lurched	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
in	1
their	1
grotesque	1

the	1

could	1
recover	1
from	1
their	1
astonishment	1
the	1
frightful	1

upon	1

from	1

down	1

went	1
down	1
the	1

here	1

everywhere	1
urging	1
on	1

taking	1
a	1
heavy	1
toll	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
slim	1
knife	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1

scattered	1
for	1

down	1
the	1

upon	1
the	1

came	1
within	1

of	1
the	1

with	1
headlong	1
leaps	1
for	1
a	1

was	1
drawn	1
well	1
up	1
upon	1

noiseless	1

awakened	1
by	1
sight	1
of	1

if	1

had	1
come	1
to	1
his	1

from	1
another	1

from	1
the	1

why	1
not	1
utilize	1
their	1
craft	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
country	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
evidently	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
inhabited	1
country	1
and	1
no	1

had	1
occasional	1

with	1
the	1

if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
itself	1
upon	1

a	1
heavy	1
hand	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
the	1
escaping	1
mugambi	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
pursued	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
his	1
assailant	1
giant	1
fingers	1
closed	1
about	1
his	1

he	1
was	1
hurled	1
to	1

astride	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
could	1

in	1
his	1

in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1

tarzan	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
prostrate	1
man	1
beneath	1
him	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
mugambi	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
wagambi	1
replied	1
the	1
black	1
i	1
will	1
spare	1
your	1
life	1
said	1
tarzan	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
promise	1
to	1

me	1
to	1
leave	1
this	1
island	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
answer	1
i	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
replied	1
mugambi	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
killed	1
all	1
my	1
warriors	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
even	1
i	1
can	1
leave	1
your	1
country	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
wield	1
the	1
paddles	1
and	1
without	1
paddlers	1
we	1
cannot	1
cross	1
the	1
water	1
tarzan	1
rose	1
and	1
allowed	1
his	1
prisoner	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
a	1
magnificent	1
specimen	1
of	1
manhood	1
a	1
black	1
counterpart	1
in	1
physique	1
of	1
the	1
splendid	1
white	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
faced	1
come	1
said	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
and	1
started	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
snarling	1
and	1
growling	1
of	1
the	1
feasting	1
pack	1
mugambi	1
drew	1
back	1
they	1
will	1
kill	1
us	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
think	1
not	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
they	1
are	1
mine	1
still	1
the	1
black	1
hesitated	1
fearful	1
of	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
approaching	1
the	1
terrible	1
creatures	1
that	1
were	1
dining	1
upon	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
his	1
warriors	1
but	1
tarzan	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
two	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
grisly	1
spectacle	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
the	1
beasts	1
looked	1
up	1
with	1
menacing	1
growls	1
but	1
tarzan	1
strode	1
in	1
among	1
them	1
dragging	1
the	1
trembling	1
wagambi	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
taught	1
the	1
apes	1
to	1
accept	1
sheeta	1
so	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
to	1
adopt	1
mugambi	1
as	1
well	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
easily	1
but	1
sheeta	1
seemed	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
devour	1
mugambi	1
s	1
warriors	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
proceed	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
with	1
mugambi	1
however	1
being	1
well	1
filled	1
he	1
contented	1
himself	1
with	1
walking	1
round	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
savage	1
emitting	1
low	1
menacing	1
growls	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
flaming	1
baleful	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
upon	1
the	1
black	1
mugambi	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
clung	1
closely	1
to	1
tarzan	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
could	1
scarce	1
control	1
his	1
laughter	1
at	1
the	1
pitiable	1
condition	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
fear	1
had	1
reduced	1
him	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
white	1
took	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
by	1
the	1
scruff	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
dragging	1
it	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wagambi	1
slapped	1
it	1
sharply	1
upon	1
the	1
nose	1
each	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
growled	1
at	1
the	1
stranger	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
a	1
man	1
mauling	1
with	1
his	1
bare	1
hands	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
relentless	1
and	1
fierce	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
carnivora	1
mugambi	1
s	1
eyes	1
bulged	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
and	1
from	1
entertaining	1
a	1
sullen	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
giant	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
prisoner	1
the	1
black	1
felt	1
an	1
almost	1
worshipping	1
awe	1
of	1
tarzan	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
sheeta	1
progressed	1
so	1
well	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
mugambi	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
hungry	1
attention	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
felt	1
a	1
degree	1
more	1
of	1
safety	1
in	1
his	1
society	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
mugambi	1
was	1
entirely	1
happy	1
or	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
his	1
new	1
environment	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
adhere	1
strictly	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
constantly	1
rolling	1
apprehensively	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
as	1
now	1
one	1
and	1
now	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
pack	1
chanced	1
to	1
wander	1
near	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
principally	1
the	1
whites	1
that	1
showed	1
together	1
tarzan	1
and	1
mugambi	1
with	1
sheeta	1
and	1
akut	1
lay	1
in	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
ford	1
for	1
a	1
deer	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
the	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
leaped	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
affrighted	1
animal	1
the	1
black	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
creature	1
died	1
of	1
fright	1
before	1
ever	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
beasts	1
touched	1
it	1
mugambi	1
built	1
a	1
fire	1
and	1
cooked	1
his	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
kill	1
but	1
tarzan	1
sheeta	1
and	1
akut	1
tore	1
theirs	1
raw	1
with	1
their	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
growling	1
among	1
themselves	1
when	1
one	1
ventured	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
another	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
after	1
all	1
strange	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
ways	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
nearly	1
related	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
than	1
were	1
the	1
savage	1
blacks	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
creatures	1
of	1
habit	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
seeming	1
necessity	1
for	1
schooling	1
ourselves	1
in	1
new	1
ways	1
ceases	1
to	1
exist	1
we	1
fall	1
naturally	1
and	1
easily	1
into	1
the	1
manners	1
and	1
customs	1
which	1
long	1
usage	1
has	1
implanted	1
ineradicably	1
within	1
us	1
mugambi	1
from	1
childhood	1
had	1
eaten	1
no	1
meat	1
until	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
cooked	1
while	1
tarzan	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
had	1
never	1
tasted	1
cooked	1
food	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
almost	1
to	1
manhood	1
and	1
only	1
within	1
the	1
past	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years	1
had	1
he	1
eaten	1
cooked	1
meat	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
a	1
lifetime	1
prompt	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
raw	1
but	1
the	1
craving	1
of	1
his	1
palate	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
to	1
him	1
cooked	1
flesh	1
was	1
spoiled	1
flesh	1
when	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
juicy	1
meat	1
of	1
a	1
fresh	1
hot	1
kill	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
with	1
relish	1
eat	1
raw	1
meat	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
buried	1
by	1
himself	1
weeks	1
before	1
and	1
enjoy	1
small	1
rodents	1
and	1
disgusting	1
grubs	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
civilized	1
a	1
revolting	1
fact	1
but	1
had	1
we	1
learned	1
in	1
childhood	1
to	1
eat	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
had	1
we	1
seen	1
all	1
those	1
about	1
us	1
eat	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
seem	1
no	1
more	1
sickening	1
to	1
us	1
now	1
than	1
do	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
greatest	1
dainties	1
at	1
which	1
a	1
savage	1
african	1
cannibal	1
would	1
look	1
with	1
repugnance	1
and	1
turn	1
up	1
his	1
nose	1
for	1
instance	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
tribe	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
lake	1
rudolph	1
that	1
will	1
eat	1
no	1
sheep	1
or	1
cattle	1
though	1
its	1
next	1
neighbors	1
do	1
so	1
near	1
by	1
is	1
another	1
tribe	1
that	1
eats	1
donkey	1
meat	1
a	1
custom	1
most	1
revolting	1
to	1
the	1
surrounding	1
tribes	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
eat	1
donkey	1
so	1
who	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nice	1
to	1
eat	1
snails	1
and	1
frogs	1
legs	1
and	1
oysters	1
but	1
disgusting	1
to	1
feed	1
upon	1
grubs	1
and	1
beetles	1
or	1
that	1
a	1
raw	1
oyster	1
hoof	1
horns	1
and	1
tail	1
is	1
less	1
revolting	1
than	1
the	1
sweet	1
clean	1
meat	1
of	1
a	1
fresh	1
killed	1
buck	1
the	1
next	1
few	1
days	1
tarzan	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
weaving	1
of	1
a	1
barkcloth	1
sail	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
equip	1
the	1
canoe	1
for	1
he	1
despaired	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
apes	1
to	1
wield	1
the	1
paddles	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
embark	1
in	1
the	1
frail	1
craft	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
mugambi	1
paddled	1
about	1
inside	1
the	1
reef	1
where	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
quite	1
smooth	1
during	1
these	1
trips	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
paddles	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
when	1
they	1
attempted	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
mugambi	1
but	1
so	1
difficult	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
long	1
to	1
concentrate	1
upon	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
weeks	1
of	1
patient	1
training	1
before	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
effective	1
use	1
of	1
these	1
new	1
implements	1
if	1
in	1
fact	1
they	1
should	1
ever	1
do	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
exception	1
however	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
akut	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
showed	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
this	1
new	1
sport	1
that	1
revealed	1
a	1
much	1
higher	1
plane	1
of	1
intelligence	1
than	1
that	1
attained	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
paddles	1
and	1
when	1
tarzan	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
so	1
he	1
took	1
much	1
pains	1
to	1
explain	1
in	1
the	1
meagre	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
advantage	1
from	1
mugambi	1
tarzan	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
mainland	1
lay	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
island	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
the	1
wagambi	1
warriors	1
had	1
ventured	1
too	1
far	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
frail	1
craft	1
and	1
when	1
caught	1
by	1
a	1
heavy	1
tide	1
and	1
a	1
high	1
wind	1
from	1
off	1
shore	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
land	1
after	1
paddling	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
night	1
thinking	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
headed	1
for	1
home	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
this	1
land	1
at	1
sunrise	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
mainland	1
had	1
hailed	1
it	1
with	1
joy	1
nor	1
had	1
mugambi	1
been	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
island	1
until	1
tarzan	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
the	1
wagambi	1
chief	1
was	1
quite	1
dubious	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
sail	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
contrivance	1
used	1
his	1
country	1
lay	1
far	1
up	1
the	1
broad	1
ugambi	1
river	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
occasion	1
that	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
had	1
found	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
ocean	1
tarzan	1
however	1
was	1
confident	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
west	1
wind	1
he	1
could	1
navigate	1
the	1
little	1
craft	1
to	1
the	1
mainland	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
decided	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
preferable	1
to	1
perish	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
than	1
to	1
remain	1
indefinitely	1
upon	1
this	1
evidently	1
uncharted	1
island	1
to	1
which	1
no	1
ships	1
might	1
ever	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
fair	1
wind	1
rose	1
he	1
embarked	1
upon	1
his	1
cruise	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
took	1
as	1
strange	1
and	1
fearsome	1
a	1
crew	1
as	1
ever	1
sailed	1
under	1
a	1
savage	1
master	1
mugambi	1
and	1
akut	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
a	1
dozen	1
great	1
males	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
akut	1
chapter	1
6	1
a	1
hideous	1
crew	1
the	1
war	1
canoe	1
with	1
its	1
savage	1
load	1
moved	1
slowly	1
toward	1
the	1
break	1
in	1
the	1
reef	1
through	1
which	1
it	1
must	1
pass	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
tarzan	1
mugambi	1
and	1
akut	1
wielded	1
the	1
paddles	1
for	1
the	1
shore	1
kept	1
the	1
west	1
wind	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
sail	1
sheeta	1
crouched	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
at	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
feet	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
best	1
to	1
tarzan	1
always	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wicked	1
beast	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
as	1
possible	1
since	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
provocation	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
any	1
than	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
evidently	1
now	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
was	1
mugambi	1
and	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
squatted	1
akut	1
while	1
between	1
akut	1
and	1
tarzan	1
the	1
twelve	1
hairy	1
apes	1
sat	1
upon	1
their	1
haunches	1
blinking	1
dubiously	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
their	1
eyes	1
longingly	1
back	1
toward	1
shore	1
all	1
went	1
well	1
until	1
the	1
canoe	1
had	1
passed	1
beyond	1
the	1
reef	1
here	1
the	1
breeze	1
struck	1
the	1
sail	1
sending	1
the	1
rude	1
craft	1
lunging	1
among	1
the	1
waves	1
that	1
ran	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
with	1
the	1
tossing	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
the	1
apes	1
became	1
panic	1
stricken	1
they	1
first	1
moved	1
uneasily	1
about	1
and	1
then	1
commenced	1
grumbling	1
and	1
whining	1
with	1
difficulty	1
akut	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
hand	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
but	1
when	1
a	1
particularly	1
large	1
wave	1
struck	1
the	1
dugout	1
simultaneously	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
squall	1
of	1
wind	1
their	1
terror	1
broke	1
all	1
bounds	1
and	1
leaping	1
to	1
their	1
feet	1
they	1
all	1
but	1
overturned	1
the	1
boat	1
before	1
akut	1
and	1
tarzan	1
together	1
could	1
quiet	1
them	1
at	1
last	1
calm	1
was	1
restored	1
and	1
eventually	1
the	1
apes	1
became	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
strange	1
antics	1
of	1
their	1
craft	1
after	1
which	1
no	1
more	1
trouble	1
was	1
experienced	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
trip	1
was	1
uneventful	1
the	1
wind	1
held	1
and	1
after	1
ten	1
hours	1
steady	1
sailing	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
coast	1
loomed	1
close	1
before	1
the	1
straining	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
too	1
dark	1
to	1
distinguish	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
approached	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
or	1
not	1
so	1
tarzan	1
ran	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
surf	1
at	1
the	1
closest	1
point	1
to	1
await	1
the	1
dawn	1
the	1
dugout	1
turned	1
broadside	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
its	1
nose	1
touched	1
the	1
sand	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
rolled	1
over	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
crew	1
scrambling	1
madly	1
for	1
the	1
shore	1
the	1
next	1
breaker	1
rolled	1
them	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
but	1
eventually	1
they	1
all	1
succeeded	1
in	1
crawling	1
to	1
safety	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
more	1
their	1
ungainly	1
craft	1
had	1
been	1
washed	1
up	1
beside	1
them	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
apes	1
sat	1
huddled	1
close	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
for	1
warmth	1
while	1
mugambi	1
built	1
a	1
fire	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
crouched	1
tarzan	1
and	1
sheeta	1
however	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
mind	1
for	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
feared	1
the	1
jungle	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
insistent	1
craving	1
of	1
their	1
hunger	1
sent	1
them	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
stygian	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
prey	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
they	1
walked	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
room	1
for	1
two	1
abreast	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
in	1
single	1
file	1
first	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
advance	1
it	1
was	1
tarzan	1
who	1
first	1
caught	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
meat	1
a	1
bull	1
buffalo	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
two	1
came	1
stealthily	1
upon	1
the	1
sleeping	1
beast	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
dense	1
jungle	1
of	1
reeds	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
river	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
they	1
crept	1
toward	1
the	1
unsuspecting	1
beast	1
sheeta	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
side	1
and	1
tarzan	1
upon	1
his	1
left	1
nearest	1
the	1
great	1
heart	1
they	1
had	1
hunted	1
together	1
now	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
worked	1
in	1
unison	1
with	1
only	1
low	1
purring	1
sounds	1
as	1
signals	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
lay	1
quite	1
silent	1
near	1
their	1
prey	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
sheeta	1
sprang	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
back	1
burying	1
his	1
strong	1
teeth	1
in	1
the	1
bull	1
s	1
neck	1
instantly	1
the	1
brute	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
bellow	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
rage	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
tarzan	1
rushed	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
left	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
stone	1
knife	1
striking	1
repeatedly	1
behind	1
the	1
shoulder	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
hands	1
clutched	1
the	1
thick	1
mane	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bull	1
raced	1
madly	1
through	1
the	1
reeds	1
the	1
thing	1
striking	1
at	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
dragged	1
beside	1
him	1
sheeta	1
but	1
clung	1
tenaciously	1
to	1
his	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
back	1
biting	1
deep	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
spine	1
for	1
several	1
hundred	1
yards	1
the	1
bellowing	1
bull	1
carried	1
his	1
two	1
savage	1
antagonists	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
blade	1
found	1
his	1
heart	1
when	1
with	1
a	1
final	1
bellow	1
that	1
was	1
half	1
scream	1
he	1
plunged	1
headlong	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
then	1
tarzan	1
and	1
sheeta	1
feasted	1
to	1
repletion	1
after	1
the	1
meal	1
the	1
two	1
curled	1
up	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
thicket	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
black	1
head	1
pillowed	1
upon	1
the	1
tawny	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
shortly	1
after	1
dawn	1
they	1
awoke	1
and	1
ate	1
again	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
beach	1
that	1
tarzan	1
might	1
lead	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
to	1
the	1
kill	1
when	1
the	1
meal	1
was	1
done	1
the	1
brutes	1
were	1
for	1
curling	1
up	1
to	1
sleep	1
so	1
tarzan	1
and	1
mugambi	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
river	1
they	1
had	1
proceeded	1
scarce	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
a	1
broad	1
stream	1
which	1
the	1
negro	1
instantly	1
recognized	1
as	1
that	1
down	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
warriors	1
had	1
paddled	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
their	1
ill	1
starred	1
expedition	1
the	1
two	1
now	1
followed	1
the	1
stream	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ocean	1
finding	1
that	1
it	1
emptied	1
into	1
a	1
bay	1
not	1
over	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
canoe	1
had	1
been	1
thrown	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
tarzan	1
was	1
much	1
elated	1
by	1
the	1
discovery	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
watercourse	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
natives	1
and	1
from	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
he	1
had	1
little	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
obtain	1
news	1
of	1
rokoff	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
reasonably	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
would	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
after	1
having	1
disposed	1
of	1
tarzan	1
he	1
and	1
mugambi	1
now	1
righted	1
and	1
launched	1
the	1
dugout	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
difficult	1
feat	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
surf	1
which	1
rolled	1
continuously	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
were	1
successful	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
were	1
paddling	1
up	1
the	1
coast	1
toward	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
here	1
they	1
experienced	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
in	1
making	1
an	1
entrance	1
against	1
the	1
combined	1
current	1
and	1
ebb	1
tide	1
but	1
by	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
eddies	1
close	1
in	1
to	1
shore	1
they	1
came	1
about	1
dusk	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
nearly	1
opposite	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
pack	1
asleep	1
making	1
the	1
craft	1
fast	1
to	1
an	1
overhanging	1
bough	1
the	1
two	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
presently	1
coming	1
upon	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
feeding	1
upon	1
fruit	1
a	1
little	1
beyond	1
the	1
reeds	1
where	1
the	1
buffalo	1
had	1
fallen	1
sheeta	1
was	1
not	1
anywhere	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
return	1
that	1
night	1
so	1
that	1
tarzan	1
came	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wandered	1
away	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
kind	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
led	1
his	1
band	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
he	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
shrill	1
cries	1
presently	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
and	1
faintly	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
answering	1
scream	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
hour	1
later	1
the	1
lithe	1
form	1
of	1
sheeta	1
bounded	1
into	1
view	1
where	1
the	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
were	1
clambering	1
gingerly	1
into	1
the	1
canoe	1
the	1
great	1
beast	1
with	1
arched	1
back	1
and	1
purring	1
like	1
a	1
contented	1
tabby	1
rubbed	1
his	1
sides	1
against	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
latter	1
sprang	1
lightly	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
dugout	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
in	1
place	1
it	1
was	1
discovered	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
were	1
missing	1
and	1
though	1
both	1
the	1
king	1
ape	1
and	1
tarzan	1
called	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
response	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
boat	1
put	1
off	1
without	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
missing	1
ones	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
who	1
had	1
evinced	1
the	1
least	1
desire	1
to	1
accompany	1
the	1
expedition	1
from	1
the	1
island	1
and	1
had	1
suffered	1
the	1
most	1
from	1
fright	1
during	1
the	1
voyage	1
tarzan	1
was	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
absented	1
themselves	1
purposely	1
rather	1
than	1
again	1
enter	1
the	1
canoe	1
as	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
putting	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
shore	1
shortly	1
after	1
noon	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
food	1
a	1
slender	1
naked	1
savage	1
watched	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
dense	1
screen	1
of	1
verdure	1
which	1
lined	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
bank	1
then	1
he	1
melted	1
away	1
up	1
stream	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
discovered	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
deer	1
he	1
bounded	1
along	1
the	1
narrow	1
trail	1
until	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
his	1
news	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
native	1
village	1
several	1
miles	1
above	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
tarzan	1
and	1
his	1
pack	1
had	1
stopped	1
to	1
hunt	1
another	1
white	1
man	1
is	1
coming	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
who	1
squatted	1
before	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
his	1
circular	1
hut	1
another	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
many	1
warriors	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
war	1
canoe	1
to	1
kill	1
and	1
rob	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
black	1
bearded	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
left	1
us	1
kaviri	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
recently	1
had	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
medicine	1
and	1
his	1
savage	1
heart	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
bitterness	1
and	1
hate	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
drums	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
calling	1
in	1
the	1
hunters	1
from	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
the	1
tillers	1
from	1
the	1
fields	1
seven	1
war	1
canoes	1
were	1
launched	1
and	1
manned	1
by	1
paint	1
daubed	1
befeathered	1
warriors	1
long	1
spears	1
bristled	1
from	1
the	1
rude	1
battle	1
ships	1
as	1
they	1
slid	1
noiselessly	1
over	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
propelled	1
by	1
giant	1
muscles	1
rolling	1
beneath	1
glistening	1
ebony	1
hides	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
beating	1
of	1
tom	1
toms	1
now	1
nor	1
blare	1
of	1
native	1
horn	1
for	1
kaviri	1
was	1
a	1
crafty	1
warrior	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
chances	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
avoided	1
he	1
would	1
swoop	1
noiselessly	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
seven	1
canoes	1
upon	1
the	1
single	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
guns	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
could	1
inflict	1
much	1
damage	1
upon	1
his	1
people	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
overwhelmed	1
the	1
enemy	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
numbers	1
kaviri	1
s	1
own	1
canoe	1
went	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
rounded	1
a	1
sharp	1
bend	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
where	1
the	1
swift	1
current	1
bore	1
it	1
rapidly	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
it	1
came	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
kaviri	1
sought	1
so	1
close	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
canoes	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
black	1
had	1
only	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
white	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
oncoming	1
craft	1
before	1
the	1
two	1
touched	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
men	1
were	1
upon	1
their	1
feet	1
yelling	1
like	1
mad	1
devils	1
and	1
thrusting	1
their	1
long	1
spears	1
at	1
the	1
occupants	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
canoe	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
when	1
kaviri	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
that	1
manned	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
dugout	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
all	1
the	1
beads	1
and	1
iron	1
wire	1
that	1
he	1
possessed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
safely	1
within	1
his	1
distant	1
village	1
scarcely	1
had	1
the	1
two	1
craft	1
come	1
together	1
than	1
the	1
frightful	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
rose	1
growling	1
and	1
barking	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
and	1
with	1
long	1
hairy	1
arms	1
far	1
outstretched	1
grasped	1
the	1
menacing	1
spears	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
kaviri	1
s	1
warriors	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
overcome	1
with	1
terror	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
fight	1
now	1
came	1
the	1
other	1
war	1
canoes	1
rapidly	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
craft	1
their	1
occupants	1
were	1
eager	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
battle	1
for	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
their	1
foes	1
were	1
white	1
men	1
and	1
their	1
native	1
porters	1
they	1
swarmed	1
about	1
tarzan	1
s	1
craft	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
all	1
but	1
one	1
turned	1
and	1
paddled	1
swiftly	1
up	1
river	1
that	1
one	1
came	1
too	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
craft	1
before	1
its	1
occupants	1
realized	1
that	1
their	1
fellows	1
were	1
pitted	1
against	1
demons	1
instead	1
of	1
men	1
as	1
it	1
touched	1
tarzan	1
spoke	1
a	1
few	1
low	1
words	1
to	1
sheeta	1
and	1
akut	1
so	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
attacking	1
warriors	1
could	1
draw	1
away	1
there	1
sprang	1
upon	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
blood	1
freezing	1
scream	1
a	1
huge	1
panther	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
canoe	1
clambered	1
a	1
great	1
ape	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
the	1
panther	1
wrought	1
fearful	1
havoc	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
talons	1
and	1
long	1
sharp	1
fangs	1
while	1
akut	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
buried	1
his	1
yellow	1
canines	1
in	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
came	1
within	1
his	1
reach	1
hurling	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
blacks	1
overboard	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
kaviri	1
was	1
so	1
busily	1
engaged	1
with	1
the	1
demons	1
that	1
had	1
entered	1
his	1
own	1
craft	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
offer	1
no	1
assistance	1
to	1
his	1
warriors	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
giant	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
devil	1
had	1
wrested	1
his	1
spear	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
the	1
mighty	1
kaviri	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
born	1
babe	1
hairy	1
monsters	1
were	1
overcoming	1
his	1
fighting	1
men	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
chieftain	1
like	1
himself	1
was	1
fighting	1
shoulder	1
to	1
shoulder	1
with	1
the	1
hideous	1
pack	1
that	1
opposed	1
him	1
kaviri	1
battled	1
bravely	1
against	1
his	1
antagonist	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
death	1
had	1
already	1
claimed	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
least	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
dearly	1
as	1
possible	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
evident	1
that	1
his	1
best	1
was	1
quite	1
futile	1
when	1
pitted	1
against	1
the	1
superhuman	1
brawn	1
and	1
agility	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
found	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
bent	1
him	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
presently	1
kaviri	1
s	1
head	1
began	1
to	1
whirl	1
objects	1
became	1
confused	1
and	1
dim	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
chest	1
as	1
he	1
struggled	1
for	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
shutting	1
off	1
for	1
ever	1
then	1
he	1
lost	1
consciousness	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
found	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
dead	1
he	1
lay	1
securely	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
canoe	1
a	1
great	1
panther	1
sat	1
upon	1
its	1
haunches	1
looking	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
kaviri	1
shuddered	1
and	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
again	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
ferocious	1
creature	1
to	1
spring	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
misery	1
of	1
terror	1
after	1
a	1
moment	1
no	1
rending	1
fangs	1
having	1
buried	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
trembling	1
body	1
he	1
again	1
ventured	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
eyes	1
beyond	1
the	1
panther	1
kneeled	1
the	1
white	1
giant	1
who	1
had	1
overcome	1
him	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
wielding	1
a	1
paddle	1
while	1
directly	1
behind	1
him	1
kaviri	1
saw	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
warriors	1
similarly	1
engaged	1
back	1
of	1
them	1
again	1
squatted	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
hairy	1
apes	1
tarzan	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
had	1
regained	1
consciousness	1
addressed	1
him	1
your	1
warriors	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
people	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
name	1
is	1
kaviri	1
he	1
said	1
yes	1
replied	1
the	1
black	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
attack	1
me	1
i	1
came	1
in	1
peace	1
another	1
white	1
man	1
came	1
in	1
peace	1
three	1
moons	1
ago	1
replied	1
kaviri	1
and	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
presents	1
of	1
a	1
goat	1
and	1
cassava	1
and	1
milk	1
he	1
set	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
his	1
guns	1
and	1
killed	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
taking	1
all	1
of	1
our	1
goats	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
this	1
other	1
white	1
man	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
harmed	1
you	1
had	1
you	1
not	1
set	1
upon	1
me	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
like	1
i	1
am	1
searching	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
wronged	1
me	1
possibly	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
black	1
beard	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
very	1
wicked	1
yes	1
very	1
wicked	1
indeed	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
white	1
child	1
with	1
him	1
asked	1
tarzan	1
his	1
heart	1
almost	1
stopped	1
as	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
black	1
s	1
answer	1
no	1
bwana	1
replied	1
kaviri	1
the	1
white	1
child	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
this	1
man	1
s	1
party	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
party	1
other	1
party	1
exclaimed	1
tarzan	1
what	1
other	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
party	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
was	1
pursuing	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
with	1
six	1
mosula	1
porters	1
they	1
passed	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
three	1
days	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
woman	1
and	1
child	1
tarzan	1
was	1
puzzled	1
the	1
child	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
little	1
jack	1
but	1
who	1
could	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
confederates	1
had	1
conspired	1
with	1
some	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
accompanied	1
the	1
russian	1
to	1
steal	1
the	1
baby	1
from	1
him	1
if	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
they	1
had	1
doubtless	1
purposed	1
returning	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
civilization	1
and	1
there	1
either	1
claiming	1
a	1
reward	1
or	1
holding	1
the	1
little	1
prisoner	1
for	1
ransom	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
rokoff	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
chasing	1
them	1
far	1
inland	1
up	1
the	1
savage	1
river	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
eventually	1
overhaul	1
them	1
unless	1
as	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
probable	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
captured	1
and	1
killed	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
cannibals	1
farther	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
to	1
whom	1
tarzan	1
was	1
now	1
convinced	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
rokoff	1
s	1
intention	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
baby	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
kaviri	1
the	1
canoes	1
had	1
been	1
moving	1
steadily	1
up	1
river	1
toward	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
village	1
kaviri	1
s	1
warriors	1
plied	1
the	1
paddles	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
canoes	1
casting	1
sidelong	1
terrified	1
glances	1
at	1
their	1
hideous	1
passengers	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
encounter	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
akut	1
eight	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
beasts	1
remaining	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
tarzan	1
and	1
mugambi	1
kaviri	1
s	1
warriors	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
terrible	1
a	1
crew	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
lives	1
momentarily	1
they	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
pounced	1
upon	1
and	1
torn	1
asunder	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
captors	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
tarzan	1
and	1
mugambi	1
and	1
akut	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
snarling	1
ill	1
natured	1
brutes	1
from	1
snapping	1
at	1
the	1
glistening	1
naked	1
bodies	1
that	1
brushed	1
against	1
them	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1

to	1

paused	1
only	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
food	1
that	1
the	1
blacks	1
furnished	1
and	1
arrange	1
with	1
the	1

for	1
a	1
dozen	1
men	1
to	1
man	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

kaviri	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
any	1
demands	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
might	1
make	1
if	1
only	1
such	1
compliance	1
would	1
hasten	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
horrid	1
pack	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
easier	1
he	1
discovered	1
to	1
promise	1
men	1
than	1
to	1
furnish	1
them	1
for	1
when	1
his	1
people	1
learned	1
his	1
intentions	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
already	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1

proceeded	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
without	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
kaviri	1
turned	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
accompany	1
tarzan	1
he	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
member	1
of	1
his	1
tribe	1
left	1
within	1
the	1
village	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
a	1
smile	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
anxious	1
to	1
accompany	1
us	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
just	1
remain	1
quietly	1
here	1
kaviri	1
and	1
presently	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
your	1
people	1
flocking	1
to	1
your	1
side	1
then	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
rose	1
and	1
calling	1
his	1
pack	1
about	1
him	1
commanded	1
that	1
mugambi	1
remain	1
with	1
kaviri	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
at	1
his	1
heels	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
grim	1
forest	1
was	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
ordinary	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
teeming	1
life	1
that	1
but	1
adds	1
to	1
its	1
lowering	1
loneliness	1
kaviri	1
and	1
mugambi	1
sat	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
palisaded	1
village	1
waiting	1
presently	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
came	1
a	1
hideous	1
sound	1
mugambi	1
recognized	1
the	1
weird	1
challenge	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
immediately	1
from	1
different	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
compass	1
rose	1
a	1
horrid	1
semicircle	1
of	1
similar	1
shrieks	1
and	1
screams	1
punctuated	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
curdling	1
cry	1
of	1

panther	1

savages	1
kaviri	1
and	1
mugambi	1
squatting	1
before	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
kaviri	1
s	1

looked	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
kaviri	1
with	1
ill	1
concealed	1
alarm	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
whispered	1
it	1
is	1

and	1
his	1

replied	1

but	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
doing	1
i	1
know	1
not	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
devouring	1
your	1

away	1

rolled	1
his	1
eyes	1
fearfully	1
toward	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
long	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
savage	1
forest	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
such	1
an	1
awful	1
fearsome	1
din	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
mingled	1
the	1
terrified	1
shrieks	1
of	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
twenty	1
long	1
minutes	1
the	1
blood	1
curdling	1
cries	1
continued	1
until	1
they	1
seemed	1
but	1
a	1
stone	1
s	1
throw	1
from	1
the	1
palisade	1
kaviri	1
rose	1
to	1
flee	1
but	1
mugambi	1
seized	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
tarzan	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
a	1
horde	1
of	1
terrified	1
natives	1
burst	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
racing	1
toward	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
their	1
huts	1
like	1
frightened	1
sheep	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
driving	1
them	1
as	1
sheep	1
might	1
be	1
driven	1
came	1
tarzan	1
and	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
hideous	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
presently	1
tarzan	1
stood	1
before	1
kaviri	1
the	1
old	1
quiet	1
smile	1
upon	1
his	1
lips	1
your	1
people	1
have	1
returned	1
my	1
brother	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
select	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
and	1
paddle	1
my	1
canoe	1
tremblingly	1
kaviri	1
tottered	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
calling	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
their	1
huts	1
but	1
none	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
summons	1
tell	1
them	1
suggested	1
tarzan	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
i	1
shall	1
send	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
after	1
them	1
kaviri	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
bid	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
entire	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
came	1
forth	1
their	1
wide	1
and	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
rolling	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
creatures	1
that	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
quickly	1
kaviri	1
designated	1
a	1
dozen	1
warriors	1
to	1
accompany	1
tarzan	1
the	1
poor	1
fellows	1
went	1
almost	1
white	1
with	1
terror	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
close	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
confines	1
of	1
the	1
canoes	1
but	1
when	1
kaviri	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
escape	1
that	1
bwana	1
tarzan	1
would	1
pursue	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
grim	1
horde	1
should	1
they	1
attempt	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
duty	1
they	1
finally	1
went	1
gloomily	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
that	1
their	1
chieftain	1
saw	1
the	1
party	1
disappear	1
about	1
a	1
headland	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
up	1
river	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
the	1
strange	1
company	1
continued	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
country	1
that	1
lies	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
almost	1
unexplored	1
ugambi	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
warriors	1
deserted	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
but	1
as	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
finally	1
learned	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
paddles	1
tarzan	1
felt	1
no	1
dismay	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
travelled	1
much	1
more	1
rapidly	1
on	1
shore	1
but	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hold	1
his	1
own	1
wild	1
crew	1
together	1
to	1
better	1
advantage	1
by	1
keeping	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
twice	1
a	1
day	1
they	1
landed	1
to	1
hunt	1
and	1
feed	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
they	1
slept	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
mainland	1
or	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
little	1
islands	1
that	1
dotted	1
the	1
river	1
before	1
them	1
the	1
natives	1
fled	1
in	1
alarm	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
only	1
deserted	1
villages	1
in	1
their	1
path	1
as	1
they	1
proceeded	1
tarzan	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
who	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
banks	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
finally	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
himself	1
leaving	1
his	1
company	1
to	1
follow	1
after	1
him	1
by	1
boat	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
mugambi	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
told	1
akut	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
i	1
will	1
join	1
you	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
said	1
now	1
i	1
go	1
ahead	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
whom	1
i	1
seek	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
halt	1
tarzan	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
lost	1
to	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
the	1
first	1
few	1
villages	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
were	1
deserted	1
showing	1
that	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
his	1
pack	1
had	1
travelled	1
rapidly	1
but	1
toward	1
evening	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
distant	1
cluster	1
of	1
thatched	1
huts	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
rude	1
palisade	1
within	1
which	1
were	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
natives	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
preparing	1
the	1
evening	1
meal	1
as	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
poised	1
above	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
giant	1
tree	1
which	1
overhung	1
the	1
palisade	1
at	1
one	1
point	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
enter	1
into	1
communication	1
with	1
these	1
people	1
without	1
either	1
frightening	1
them	1
or	1
arousing	1
their	1
savage	1
love	1
of	1
battle	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
fight	1
now	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
important	1
mission	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
battling	1
with	1
every	1
chance	1
tribe	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
hit	1
upon	1
a	1
plan	1
and	1
after	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
those	1
below	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
few	1
hoarse	1
grunts	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
a	1
panther	1
all	1
eyes	1
immediately	1
turned	1
upward	1
toward	1
the	1
foliage	1
above	1
it	1
was	1
growing	1
dark	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
penetrate	1
the	1
leafy	1
screen	1
which	1
shielded	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
from	1
their	1
view	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
won	1
their	1
attention	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
shriller	1
and	1
more	1
hideous	1
scream	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
he	1
personated	1
and	1
then	1
scarce	1
stirring	1
a	1
leaf	1
in	1
his	1
descent	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
once	1
again	1
outside	1
the	1
palisade	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
a	1
deer	1
ran	1
quickly	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
here	1
he	1
beat	1
upon	1
the	1
fibre	1
bound	1
saplings	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
barrier	1
was	1
constructed	1
shouting	1
to	1
the	1
natives	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
tongue	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
who	1
wished	1
food	1
and	1
shelter	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
tarzan	1
knew	1
well	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
grunting	1
and	1
screaming	1
of	1
sheeta	1
in	1
the	1
tree	1
above	1
them	1
would	1
set	1
their	1
nerves	1
on	1
edge	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
pounding	1
upon	1
their	1
gate	1
after	1
dark	1
would	1
still	1
further	1
add	1
to	1
their	1
terror	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
hail	1
was	1
no	1
surprise	1
for	1
natives	1
are	1
fearful	1
of	1
any	1
voice	1
that	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
from	1
beyond	1
their	1
palisades	1
attributing	1
it	1
always	1
to	1
some	1
demon	1
or	1
other	1
ghostly	1
visitor	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
call	1
let	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
friends	1
he	1
cried	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
pursuing	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
passed	1
this	1
way	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
i	1
follow	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
he	1
has	1
committed	1
against	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
doubt	1
my	1
friendship	1
i	1
will	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
tree	1
above	1
your	1
village	1
and	1
driving	1
sheeta	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
before	1
he	1
leaps	1
among	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
promise	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
in	1
and	1
treat	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
friend	1
i	1
shall	1
let	1
sheeta	1
stay	1
and	1
devour	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
then	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
indeed	1
a	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
friend	1
we	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
come	1
in	1
but	1
first	1
you	1
must	1
drive	1
sheeta	1
away	1
very	1
well	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
listen	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
sheeta	1
fleeing	1
before	1
me	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
returned	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
noise	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
branches	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
growling	1
ominously	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
so	1
that	1
those	1
below	1
would	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
beast	1
was	1
still	1
there	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
point	1
well	1
above	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
commotion	1
shaking	1
the	1
tree	1
violently	1
crying	1
aloud	1
to	1
the	1
panther	1
to	1
flee	1
or	1
be	1
killed	1
and	1
punctuating	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
with	1
the	1
screams	1
and	1
mouthings	1
of	1
an	1
angry	1
beast	1
presently	1
he	1
raced	1
toward	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
and	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
pounding	1
loudly	1
against	1
the	1
boles	1
of	1
trees	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
voicing	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
diminishing	1
growls	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
calling	1
to	1
the	1
natives	1
within	1
i	1
have	1
driven	1
sheeta	1
away	1
he	1
said	1
now	1
come	1
and	1
admit	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
promised	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
excited	1
discussion	1
within	1
the	1
palisade	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
warriors	1
came	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
gates	1
peering	1
anxiously	1
out	1
in	1
evident	1
trepidation	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
find	1
waiting	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
much	1
relieved	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
an	1
almost	1
naked	1
white	1
man	1
but	1
when	1
tarzan	1
had	1
reassured	1
them	1
in	1
quiet	1
tones	1
protesting	1
his	1
friendship	1
for	1
them	1
they	1
opened	1
the	1
barrier	1
a	1
trifle	1
farther	1
and	1
admitted	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
gates	1
had	1
been	1
once	1
more	1
secured	1
the	1
self	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
returned	1
and	1
as	1
tarzan	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
toward	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
hut	1
he	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
curious	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
rokoff	1
had	1
passed	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
a	1
week	1
previous	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
horns	1
growing	1
from	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
was	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
devils	1
later	1
the	1
chief	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
bad	1
white	1
man	1
had	1
remained	1
a	1
month	1
in	1
his	1
village	1
though	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
statements	1
agreed	1
with	1
kaviri	1
s	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
was	1
but	1
three	1
days	1
gone	1
from	1
the	1
chieftain	1
s	1
village	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
following	1
was	1
much	1
smaller	1
than	1
now	1
stated	1
tarzan	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
manner	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
discrepancies	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
familiar	1
with	1
the	1
savage	1
mind	1
s	1
strange	1
manner	1
of	1
functioning	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
most	1
interested	1
in	1
knowing	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
trail	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
led	1
toward	1
the	1
interior	1
in	1
this	1
circumstance	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
rokoff	1
could	1
never	1
escape	1
him	1
after	1
several	1
hours	1
of	1
questioning	1
and	1
cross	1
questioning	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
learned	1
that	1
another	1
party	1
had	1
preceded	1
the	1
russian	1
by	1
several	1
days	1
three	1
whites	1
a	1
man	1
a	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
man	1
child	1
with	1
several	1
mosulas	1
tarzan	1
explained	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
that	1
his	1
people	1
would	1
follow	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
canoe	1
probably	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
on	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
chief	1
was	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
kindly	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
mugambi	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
harm	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
people	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
accorded	1
a	1
friendly	1
reception	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
concluded	1
i	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
beneath	1
this	1
tree	1
and	1
sleep	1
i	1
am	1
very	1
tired	1
permit	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
disturb	1
me	1
the	1
chief	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
hut	1
but	1
tarzan	1
from	1
past	1
experience	1
of	1
native	1
dwellings	1
preferred	1
the	1
open	1
air	1
and	1
further	1
he	1
had	1
plans	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
better	1
carried	1
out	1
if	1
he	1
remained	1
beneath	1
the	1
tree	1
he	1
gave	1
as	1
his	1
reason	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
should	1
sheeta	1
return	1
and	1
after	1
this	1
explanation	1
the	1
chief	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
sleep	1
beneath	1
the	1
tree	1
tarzan	1
had	1
always	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
stood	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
stead	1
to	1
leave	1
with	1
natives	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
possessed	1
of	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
miraculous	1
powers	1
he	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
entered	1
their	1
village	1
without	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
but	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
unaccountable	1
disappearance	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
would	1
result	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
lasting	1
impression	1
upon	1
their	1
childlike	1
minds	1
and	1
so	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
village	1
was	1
quiet	1
in	1
sleep	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
leaping	1
into	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
above	1
him	1
faded	1
silently	1
into	1
the	1
black	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
that	1
night	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
swung	1
rapidly	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
and	1
middle	1
terraces	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
when	1
the	1
going	1
was	1
good	1
there	1
he	1
preferred	1
the	1
upper	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
trees	1
for	1
then	1
his	1
way	1
was	1
better	1
lighted	1
by	1
the	1
moon	1
but	1
so	1
accustomed	1
were	1
all	1
his	1
senses	1
to	1
the	1
grim	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
birth	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
for	1
him	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
black	1
shadows	1
near	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
move	1
with	1
ease	1
and	1
rapidity	1
you	1
or	1
i	1
walking	1
beneath	1
the	1
arcs	1
of	1
main	1
street	1
or	1
broadway	1
or	1
state	1
street	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
moved	1
more	1
surely	1
or	1
with	1
a	1
tenth	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
agile	1
ape	1
man	1
through	1
the	1
gloomy	1
mazes	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
baffled	1
us	1
entirely	1
at	1
dawn	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
feed	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
slept	1
for	1
several	1
hours	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
pursuit	1
again	1
toward	1
noon	1
twice	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
natives	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
in	1
approaching	1
them	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
each	1
instance	1
in	1
quieting	1
both	1
their	1
fears	1
and	1
bellicose	1
intentions	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
learned	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
two	1
days	1
later	1
still	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
large	1
village	1
the	1
chief	1
a	1
wicked	1
looking	1
fellow	1
with	1
the	1
sharp	1
filed	1
teeth	1
that	1
often	1
denote	1
the	1
cannibal	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
apparent	1
friendliness	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
now	1
thoroughly	1
fatigued	1
and	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
hours	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
fresh	1
and	1
strong	1
when	1
he	1
caught	1
up	1
with	1
rokoff	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
the	1
chief	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
bearded	1
white	1
man	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
village	1
only	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
and	1
that	1
doubtless	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
overtake	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
the	1
other	1
party	1
the	1
chief	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
tarzan	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
or	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
fellow	1
who	1
seemed	1
though	1
friendly	1
enough	1
to	1
harbour	1
a	1
certain	1
contempt	1
for	1
this	1
half	1
naked	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
no	1
followers	1
and	1
offered	1
no	1
presents	1
but	1
he	1
needed	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
food	1
that	1
the	1
village	1
would	1
afford	1
him	1
with	1
less	1
effort	1
than	1
the	1
jungle	1
and	1
so	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
man	1
beast	1
or	1
devil	1
he	1
curled	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
hut	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
asleep	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
chief	1
than	1
the	1
latter	1
called	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
warriors	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
whispered	1
a	1
few	1
instructions	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
sleek	1
black	1
bodies	1
were	1
racing	1
along	1
the	1
river	1
path	1
up	1
stream	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
chief	1
maintained	1
perfect	1
quiet	1
he	1
would	1
permit	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
sleeping	1
visitor	1
nor	1
any	1
singing	1
nor	1
loud	1
talking	1
he	1
was	1
remarkably	1
solicitous	1
lest	1
his	1
guest	1
be	1
disturbed	1
three	1
hours	1
later	1
several	1
canoes	1
came	1
silently	1
into	1
view	1
from	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
pushed	1
ahead	1
rapidly	1
by	1
the	1
brawny	1
muscles	1
of	1
their	1
black	1
crews	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
before	1
the	1
river	1
stood	1
the	1
chief	1
his	1
spear	1
raised	1
in	1
a	1
horizontal	1
position	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
some	1
manner	1
of	1
predetermined	1
signal	1
to	1
those	1
within	1
the	1
boats	1
and	1
such	1
indeed	1
was	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
his	1
attitude	1
which	1
meant	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
stranger	1
within	1
his	1
village	1
still	1
slept	1
peacefully	1
in	1
the	1
bows	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
canoes	1
were	1
the	1
runners	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
had	1
sent	1
forth	1
three	1
hours	1
earlier	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
dispatched	1
to	1
follow	1
and	1
bring	1
back	1
this	1
party	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
signal	1
from	1
the	1
bank	1
was	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
determined	1
upon	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
village	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
dugouts	1
drew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
verdure	1
clad	1
bank	1
the	1
native	1
warriors	1
filed	1
out	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
white	1
men	1
sullen	1
ugly	1
looking	1
customers	1
they	1
were	1
and	1
none	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
the	1
evil	1
faced	1
black	1
bearded	1
man	1
who	1
commanded	1
them	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
your	1
messengers	1
report	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
this	1
way	1
bwana	1
replied	1
the	1
native	1
carefully	1
have	1
i	1
kept	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
still	1
asleep	1
when	1
you	1
returned	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
who	1
seeks	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
harm	1
but	1
he	1
questioned	1
me	1
closely	1
about	1
your	1
coming	1
and	1
your	1
going	1
and	1
his	1
appearance	1
is	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
you	1
described	1
but	1
whom	1
you	1
believed	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
you	1
called	1
jungle	1
island	1
had	1
you	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
this	1
tale	1
i	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
after	1
and	1
slain	1
you	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
no	1
enemy	1
then	1
no	1
harm	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
bwana	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
proves	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
enemy	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
rifle	1
and	1
some	1
ammunition	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
well	1
replied	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
rifle	1
and	1
ammunition	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
or	1
enemy	1
provided	1
that	1
you	1
stand	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
shall	1
stand	1
with	1
you	1
bwana	1
said	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
now	1
come	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
stranger	1
who	1
sleeps	1
within	1
my	1
village	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
unconscious	1
tarzan	1
slept	1
peacefully	1
behind	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
came	1
the	1
remaining	1
whites	1
and	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
warriors	1
but	1
the	1
raised	1
forefingers	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
held	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
perfect	1
silence	1
as	1
they	1
turned	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
cautiously	1
and	1
upon	1
tiptoe	1
an	1
ugly	1
smile	1
touched	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
giant	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
ape	1
man	1
the	1
chief	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
inquiringly	1
the	1
latter	1
nodded	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
signify	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
had	1
made	1
no	1
mistake	1
in	1
his	1
suspicions	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
those	1
behind	1
him	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
sleeping	1
man	1
motioned	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
seize	1
and	1
bind	1
him	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
a	1
dozen	1
brutes	1
had	1
leaped	1
upon	1
the	1
surprised	1
tarzan	1
and	1
so	1
quickly	1
did	1
they	1
work	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
securely	1
bound	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
half	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
escape	1
then	1
they	1
threw	1
him	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
turned	1
toward	1
the	1
crowd	1
that	1
stood	1
near	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
malign	1
face	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
a	1
sneer	1
curled	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
lips	1
he	1
stepped	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
tarzan	1
pig	1
he	1
cried	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
learned	1
sufficient	1
wisdom	1

the	1
dance	1
of	1
death	1
through	1
the	1
luxuriant	1
tangled	1
vegetation	1
of	1
the	1
stygian	1
jungle	1
night	1
a	1
great	1
lithe	1
body	1
made	1
its	1
way	1
sinuously	1
and	1
in	1
utter	1
silence	1
upon	1
its	1
soft	1
padded	1
feet	1
only	1
two	1
blazing	1
points	1
of	1
yellow	1
green	1
flame	1
shone	1
occasionally	1
with	1
the	1
reflected	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
equatorial	1
moon	1
that	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
pierced	1
the	1
softly	1
sighing	1
roof	1
rustling	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
wind	1
occasionally	1
the	1
beast	1
would	1
stop	1
with	1
high	1
held	1
nose	1
sniffing	1
searchingly	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
a	1
quick	1
brief	1
incursion	1
into	1
the	1
branches	1
above	1
delayed	1
it	1
momentarily	1
in	1
its	1
steady	1
journey	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
its	1
sensitive	1
nostrils	1
came	1
the	1
subtle	1
unseen	1
spoor	1
of	1
many	1
a	1
tender	1
four	1
footed	1
creature	1
bringing	1
the	1
slaver	1
of	1
hunger	1
to	1
the	1
cruel	1
drooping	1
jowl	1
but	1
steadfastly	1
it	1
kept	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
strangely	1
ignoring	1
the	1
cravings	1
of	1
appetite	1
that	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
would	1
have	1
sent	1
the	1
rolling	1
fur	1
clad	1
muscles	1
flying	1
at	1
some	1
soft	1
throat	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
the	1
creature	1
pursued	1
its	1
lonely	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
it	1
halted	1
only	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
single	1
kill	1
which	1
it	1
tore	1
to	1
fragments	1
and	1
devoured	1
with	1
sullen	1
grumbling	1
rumbles	1
as	1
though	1
half	1
famished	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
food	1
it	1
was	1
dusk	1
when	1
it	1
approached	1
the	1
palisade	1
that	1
surrounded	1
a	1
large	1
native	1
village	1
like	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
swift	1
and	1
silent	1
death	1
it	1
circled	1
the	1
village	1
nose	1
to	1
ground	1
halting	1
at	1
last	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
palisade	1
where	1
it	1
almost	1
touched	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
several	1
huts	1
here	1
the	1
beast	1
sniffed	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
its	1
head	1
upon	1
one	1
side	1
listened	1
with	1
up	1
pricked	1
ears	1
what	1
it	1
heard	1
was	1
no	1
sound	1
by	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
human	1
ears	1
yet	1
to	1
the	1
highly	1
attuned	1
and	1
delicate	1
organs	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
a	1
message	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
to	1
the	1
savage	1
brain	1
a	1
wondrous	1
transformation	1
was	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
motionless	1
mass	1
of	1
statuesque	1
bone	1
and	1
muscle	1
that	1
had	1
an	1
instant	1
before	1
stood	1
as	1
though	1
carved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
bronze	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
poised	1
upon	1
steel	1
springs	1
suddenly	1
released	1
it	1
rose	1
quickly	1
and	1
silently	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
palisade	1
disappearing	1
stealthily	1
and	1
cat	1
like	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
space	1
between	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
adjacent	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1

were	1
preparing	1
many	1
little	1
fires	1
and	1
fetching	1

filled	1
with	1
water	1
for	1

to	1

ere	1
the	1

about	1
a	1
stout	1
stake	1
near	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circling	1
fires	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
black	1
warriors	1
stood	1
conversing	1
their	1
bodies	1
smeared	1
with	1
white	1
and	1
blue	1
and	1
ochre	1
in	1
broad	1
and	1
grotesque	1
bands	1

circles	1
of	1

were	1
drawn	1
about	1
their	1

from	1

bits	1
of	1
long	1

the	1

was	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
feast	1
while	1
in	1
a	1
hut	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
orgy	1
the	1
bound	1
victim	1
of	1
their	1
bestial	1
appetites	1
lay	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
end	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
tensing	1
his	1
mighty	1
muscles	1
strained	1
at	1
the	1
bonds	1
that	1
pinioned	1
him	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
re	1
enforced	1
many	1
times	1
at	1
the	1
instigation	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
so	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
giant	1
brawn	1
could	1
budge	1
them	1
death	1
tarzan	1
had	1
looked	1
the	1
hideous	1
hunter	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
smile	1
again	1
tonight	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
coming	1
quickly	1
but	1
now	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
himself	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
others	1
the	1
dear	1
ones	1
who	1
must	1
suffer	1
most	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
passing	1
jane	1
would	1
never	1
know	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
thanked	1
heaven	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
thankful	1
also	1
that	1
she	1
at	1
least	1
was	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
s	1
greatest	1
city	1
safe	1
among	1
kind	1
and	1
loving	1
friends	1
who	1
would	1
do	1
their	1
best	1
to	1
lighten	1
her	1
misery	1
but	1
the	1
boy	1
tarzan	1
writhed	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
the	1
mighty	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
he	1
tarzan	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
fitted	1
to	1
find	1
and	1
save	1
the	1
child	1
from	1
the	1
horrors	1
that	1
rokoff	1
s	1
evil	1
mind	1
had	1
planned	1
had	1
been	1
trapped	1
like	1
a	1
silly	1
dumb	1
creature	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
would	1
go	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
last	1
chance	1
of	1
succour	1
rokoff	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
revile	1
and	1
abuse	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
during	1
the	1
afternoon	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
wring	1
no	1
word	1
of	1
remonstrance	1
or	1
murmur	1
of	1
pain	1
from	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
captive	1
so	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
reserving	1
his	1
particular	1
bit	1
of	1
exquisite	1
mental	1
torture	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
when	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
savage	1
spears	1
of	1
the	1
cannibals	1
should	1
for	1
ever	1
make	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
hatred	1
immune	1
to	1
further	1
suffering	1
the	1
russian	1
planned	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
his	1
enemy	1
the	1
true	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
whom	1
he	1
thought	1
safe	1
in	1
england	1
dusk	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
the	1
ape	1
men	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
preparations	1
going	1
forward	1
for	1
the	1
torture	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
the	1
dance	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
could	1
picture	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
s	1
eye	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
thing	1
many	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
central	1
figure	1
bound	1
to	1
the	1
stake	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
the	1
slow	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
circling	1
warriors	1
cut	1
him	1
to	1
bits	1
with	1
the	1
fiendish	1
skill	1
that	1
mutilated	1
without	1
bringing	1
unconsciousness	1
had	1
no	1
terrors	1
for	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
inured	1
to	1
suffering	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
to	1
cruel	1
death	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
live	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
strong	1
within	1
him	1
and	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
spark	1
of	1
life	1
should	1
flicker	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
his	1
whole	1
being	1
would	1
remain	1
quick	1
with	1
hope	1
and	1
determination	1
let	1
them	1
relax	1
their	1
watchfulness	1
but	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
cunning	1
mind	1
and	1
giant	1
muscles	1
would	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
escape	1
escape	1
and	1
revenge	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
thinking	1
furiously	1
on	1
every	1
possibility	1
of	1
self	1
salvation	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
sensitive	1
nostrils	1
a	1
faint	1
and	1
a	1
familiar	1
scent	1
instantly	1
every	1
faculty	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
alert	1
presently	1
his	1
trained	1
ears	1
caught	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
soundless	1
presence	1
without	1
behind	1
the	1
hut	1
wherein	1
he	1
lay	1
his	1
lips	1
moved	1
and	1
though	1
no	1
sound	1
came	1
forth	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
appreciable	1
to	1
a	1
human	1
ear	1
beyond	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
his	1
prison	1
yet	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
beyond	1
would	1
hear	1
already	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
that	1
one	1
was	1
for	1
his	1
nostrils	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
your	1
eyes	1
or	1
mine	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
whom	1
we	1
come	1
upon	1
in	1
broad	1
daylight	1
an	1
instant	1
later	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
soft	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
fur	1
clad	1
body	1
and	1
padded	1
feet	1
scaling	1
the	1
outer	1
wall	1
behind	1
the	1
hut	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
tearing	1
at	1
the	1
poles	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
wall	1
presently	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
thus	1
made	1
slunk	1
a	1
great	1
beast	1
pressing	1
its	1
cold	1
muzzle	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
neck	1
it	1
was	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
the	1
beast	1
snuffed	1
round	1
the	1
prostrate	1
man	1
whining	1
a	1
little	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
limit	1
to	1
the	1
interchange	1
of	1
ideas	1
which	1
could	1
take	1
place	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
and	1
so	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
sheeta	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
communicate	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
tied	1
and	1
helpless	1
sheeta	1
could	1
of	1
course	1
see	1
but	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
this	1
would	1
carry	1
any	1
suggestion	1
of	1
harm	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
concerned	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
beast	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
augured	1
well	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
might	1
accomplish	1
but	1
when	1
tarzan	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
sheeta	1
to	1
gnaw	1
his	1
bonds	1
asunder	1
the	1
great	1
animal	1
could	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
instead	1
but	1
licked	1
the	1
wrists	1
and	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
prisoner	1
presently	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
interruption	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
hut	1
sheeta	1
gave	1
a	1
low	1
growl	1
and	1
slunk	1
into	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
corner	1
evidently	1
the	1
visitor	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
warning	1
sound	1
for	1
almost	1
immediately	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
hut	1
a	1
tall	1
naked	1
savage	1
warrior	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
tarzan	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
pricked	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
spear	1
from	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
came	1
a	1
weird	1
uncanny	1
sound	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
it	1
there	1
leaped	1
from	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
s	1
farthermost	1
corner	1
a	1
bolt	1
of	1
fur	1
clad	1
death	1
full	1
upon	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
painted	1
savage	1
the	1
great	1
beast	1
struck	1
burying	1
sharp	1
talons	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
flesh	1
and	1
sinking	1
great	1
yellow	1
fangs	1
in	1
the	1
ebon	1
throat	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fearful	1
scream	1
of	1
anguish	1
and	1
terror	1
from	1
the	1
black	1
and	1
mingled	1
with	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
hideous	1
challenge	1
of	1
the	1
killing	1
panther	1
then	1
came	1
silence	1
silence	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
rending	1
of	1
bloody	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
crunching	1
of	1
human	1
bones	1
between	1
mighty	1
jaws	1
the	1
noise	1
had	1
brought	1
sudden	1
quiet	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
without	1
then	1
there	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
in	1
consultation	1
high	1
pitched	1
fear	1
filled	1
voices	1
and	1
deep	1
low	1
tones	1
of	1
authority	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
spoke	1
tarzan	1
and	1
the	1
panther	1
heard	1
the	1
approaching	1
footsteps	1
of	1
many	1
men	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
tarzan	1
s	1
surprise	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
rose	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
its	1
kill	1
and	1
slunk	1
noiselessly	1
from	1
the	1
hut	1
through	1
the	1
aperture	1
through	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
man	1
heard	1
the	1
soft	1
scraping	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
palisade	1
and	1
then	1
silence	1
from	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
savages	1
approaching	1
to	1
investigate	1
he	1
had	1
little	1
hope	1
that	1

the	1

cat	1
intended	1
to	1
defend	1
him	1
against	1
all	1
comers	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
as	1
it	1
heard	1
the	1
approaching	1
savages	1
without	1
tarzan	1
knew	1
how	1
strange	1
were	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
the	1
brains	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
carnivora	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
how	1
fiendishly	1
fearless	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
certain	1
death	1
and	1
again	1
how	1
timid	1
upon	1
the	1
slightest	1
provocation	1
there	1
was	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
some	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
blacks	1
vibrating	1
with	1
fear	1
had	1
struck	1
an	1
answering	1
chord	1
in	1
the	1
nervous	1
system	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
sending	1
him	1
slinking	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
his	1
tail	1
between	1
his	1
legs	1
the	1
man	1
shrugged	1
well	1
what	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
what	1
might	1
sheeta	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
maul	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
his	1
enemies	1
before	1
a	1
rifle	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
whites	1
should	1
have	1
dispatched	1
him	1
if	1
the	1
cat	1
could	1
have	1
released	1
him	1
ah	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
resulted	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
story	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
proved	1
beyond	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
sheeta	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
gone	1
and	1
tarzan	1
must	1
definitely	1
abandon	1
hope	1
the	1
natives	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
now	1
peering	1
fearfully	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
interior	1
two	1
in	1
advance	1
held	1
lighted	1
torches	1
in	1
their	1
left	1
hands	1
and	1
ready	1
spears	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
they	1
held	1
back	1
timorously	1
against	1
those	1
behind	1
who	1
were	1
pushing	1
them	1
forward	1
the	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
s	1
victim	1
mingled	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
had	1
wrought	1
mightily	1
upon	1
their	1
poor	1
nerves	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
awful	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
interior	1
seemed	1
even	1
more	1
terribly	1
ominous	1
than	1
had	1
the	1
frightful	1
screaming	1
presently	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
forced	1
unwillingly	1
within	1
hit	1
upon	1
a	1
happy	1
scheme	1
for	1
learning	1
first	1
the	1
precise	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
menaced	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
silent	1
interior	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
movement	1
he	1
flung	1
his	1
lighted	1
torch	1
into	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
instantly	1
all	1
within	1
was	1
illuminated	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
second	1
before	1
the	1
burning	1
brand	1
was	1
dashed	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
earth	1
floor	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
prisoner	1
still	1
securely	1
bound	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
last	1
seen	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
another	1
figure	1
equally	1
as	1
motionless	1
its	1
throat	1
and	1
breasts	1
horribly	1
torn	1
and	1
mangled	1
the	1
sight	1
that	1
met	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
savages	1
inspired	1
more	1
terror	1
within	1
their	1
superstitious	1
breasts	1
than	1
would	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
sheeta	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
ferocious	1
attack	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
fellows	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
cause	1
their	1
fear	1
ridden	1
minds	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
attribute	1
the	1
ghastly	1
work	1
to	1
supernatural	1
causes	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
they	1
turned	1
screaming	1
from	1
the	1
hut	1
bowling	1
over	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
directly	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
exuberance	1
of	1
their	1
terror	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
tarzan	1
heard	1
only	1
the	1
murmur	1
of	1
excited	1
voices	1
from	1
the	1
far	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
evidently	1
the	1
savages	1
were	1
once	1
more	1
attempting	1
to	1
work	1
up	1
their	1
flickering	1
courage	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
that	1
would	1
permit	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
another	1
invasion	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
for	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
came	1
a	1
savage	1
yell	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
warriors	1
give	1
to	1
bolster	1
up	1
their	1
bravery	1
upon	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
was	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
whites	1
who	1
first	1
entered	1
carrying	1
torches	1
and	1
guns	1
tarzan	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
rokoff	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
wagered	1
his	1
soul	1
that	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
could	1
have	1
tempted	1
that	1
great	1
coward	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
unknown	1
menace	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
when	1
the	1
natives	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
men	1
were	1
not	1
attacked	1
they	1
too	1
crowded	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
their	1
voices	1
hushed	1
with	1
terror	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
mutilated	1
corpse	1
of	1
their	1
comrade	1
the	1
whites	1
tried	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
elicit	1
an	1
explanation	1
from	1
tarzan	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
queries	1
he	1
but	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
grim	1
and	1
knowing	1
smile	1
curving	1
his	1
lips	1
at	1
last	1
rokoff	1
came	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
very	1
white	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
the	1
bloody	1
thing	1
grinning	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
the	1
face	1
set	1
in	1
a	1
death	1
mask	1
of	1
excruciating	1
horror	1
come	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
let	1
us	1
get	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
finish	1
this	1
demon	1
before	1
he	1
has	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
repeat	1
this	1
thing	1
upon	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
people	1
the	1
chief	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
tarzan	1
should	1
be	1
lifted	1
and	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
stake	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
several	1
minutes	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
prevail	1
upon	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
prisoner	1
at	1
last	1
however	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
warriors	1
dragged	1
tarzan	1
roughly	1
from	1
the	1
hut	1
and	1
once	1
outside	1
the	1
pall	1
of	1
terror	1
seemed	1
lifted	1
from	1
the	1
savage	1
hearts	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
howling	1
blacks	1
pushed	1
and	1
buffeted	1
the	1
prisoner	1
down	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
post	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
little	1
fires	1
and	1
boiling	1
cooking	1
pots	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
fast	1
and	1
seemed	1
quite	1
helpless	1
and	1
beyond	1
the	1
faintest	1
hope	1
of	1
succour	1
rokoff	1
s	1
shrivelled	1
wart	1
of	1
courage	1
swelled	1
to	1
its	1
usual	1
proportions	1
when	1
danger	1
was	1
not	1
present	1
he	1
stepped	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
and	1
seizing	1
a	1
spear	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
prod	1
the	1
helpless	1
victim	1
a	1
little	1
stream	1
of	1
blood	1
trickled	1
down	1
the	1
giant	1
s	1
smooth	1
skin	1
from	1
the	1
wound	1
in	1
his	1
side	1
but	1
no	1
murmur	1
of	1
pain	1
passed	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
contempt	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
infuriate	1
the	1
russian	1
with	1
a	1
volley	1
of	1
oaths	1
he	1
leaped	1
at	1
the	1
helpless	1
captive	1
beating	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fists	1
and	1
kicking	1
him	1
mercilessly	1
about	1
the	1
legs	1
then	1
he	1
raised	1
the	1
heavy	1
spear	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
mighty	1
heart	1
and	1
still	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
upon	1
him	1
before	1
rokoff	1
could	1
drive	1
the	1
weapon	1
home	1
the	1
chief	1
sprang	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
dragged	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
intended	1
victim	1
stop	1

man	1
he	1
cried	1
rob	1
us	1

prisoner	1
and	1
our	1
death	1
dance	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
take	1

place	1
the	1
threat	1
proved	1
most	1
effective	1
in	1
keeping	1
the	1
russian	1
from	1
further	1
assaults	1
upon	1
the	1
prisoner	1
though	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
stand	1
a	1
little	1
apart	1
and	1
hurl	1
taunts	1
at	1
his	1
enemy	1
he	1
told	1

that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1

upon	1
the	1

repellent	1
cook	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
upon	1
which	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
ay	1
tank	1
it	1
blow	1
purty	1
soon	1
purty	1
hard	1
replied	1
the	1
swede	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
no	1
other	1
english	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
ceased	1
to	1
importune	1
him	1
for	1
information	1
but	1
never	1
did	1
she	1
forget	1
to	1
greet	1
him	1
pleasantly	1
or	1
to	1
thank	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
hideous	1
nauseating	1
meals	1
he	1
brought	1
her	1
three	1
days	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
tarzan	1
had	1
been	1
marooned	1
the	1
kincaid	1
came	1
to	1
anchor	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
river	1
and	1
presently	1
rokoff	1
came	1
to	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
cabin	1
we	1
have	1
arrived	1
my	1
dear	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sickening	1
leer	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
safety	1
liberty	1
and	1
ease	1
my	1
heart	1
has	1
been	1
softened	1
toward	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
suffering	1
and	1
i	1
would	1
make	1
amends	1
as	1
best	1
i	1
may	1
your	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
brute	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
best	1
who	1
found	1
him	1
naked	1
in	1
his	1
native	1
jungle	1
roaming	1
wild	1
with	1
the	1
savage	1
beasts	1
that	1
were	1
his	1
fellows	1
now	1
i	1
am	1
a	1
gentleman	1
not	1
only	1
born	1
of	1
noble	1
blood	1
but	1
raised	1
gently	1
as	1
befits	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
quality	1
to	1
you	1
dear	1
jane	1
i	1
offer	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
cultured	1
man	1
and	1
association	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
culture	1
and	1
refinement	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
sorely	1
missed	1
in	1
your	1
relations	1
with	1
the	1
poor	1
ape	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
girlish	1
infatuation	1
you	1
married	1
so	1
thoughtlessly	1
i	1
love	1
you	1
jane	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
no	1
further	1

anderssen	1
paused	1
with	1
the	1
noonday	1
meal	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
carrying	1
to	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
upon	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
stringy	1
neck	1
his	1
little	1
head	1
was	1
cocked	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
his	1
close	1
set	1
eyes	1
were	1
half	1
closed	1
his	1
ears	1
so	1
expressive	1
was	1
his	1
whole	1
attitude	1
of	1
stealthy	1
eavesdropping	1
seemed	1
truly	1
to	1
be	1
cocked	1
forward	1
even	1
his	1
long	1
yellow	1
straggly	1
moustache	1
appeared	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
sly	1
droop	1
as	1
rokoff	1
closed	1
his	1
appeal	1
awaiting	1
the	1
reply	1
he	1
invited	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
surprise	1
upon	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
face	1
turned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
disgust	1
she	1
fairly	1
shuddered	1
in	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
face	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
m	1
rokoff	1
she	1
said	1
had	1
you	1
attempted	1
to	1
force	1
me	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
your	1
evil	1
desires	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
fatuous	1
as	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
i	1
wife	1
of	1
john	1
clayton	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
willingly	1
even	1
to	1
save	1
my	1
life	1

should	1
never	1
have	1
imagined	1
i	1
have	1
known	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
m	1
rokoff	1
but	1
until	1
now	1
i	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
fool	1
rokoff	1
s	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
of	1
mortification	1
flushed	1
out	1
the	1
pallor	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
toward	1
the	1
girl	1
threateningly	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
fool	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
hissed	1
when	1
i	1
have	1
broken	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
your	1
plebeian	1
yankee	1
stubbornness	1
has	1
cost	1
you	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
hold	1
dear	1
even	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
your	1
baby	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1

peter	1
i	1
ll	1
forego	1
all	1
that	1
i	1
had	1
planned	1
for	1
the	1
brat	1
and	1
cut	1
its	1
heart	1
out	1
before	1
your	1
very	1
eyes	1

ll	1
learn	1
what	1
it	1
means	1
to	1
insult	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
jane	1
clayton	1
turned	1
wearily	1
away	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
she	1
said	1
of	1
expatiating	1
upon	1
the	1
depths	1
to	1
which	1
your	1
vengeful	1
nature	1
can	1
sink	1
you	1
cannot	1
move	1
me	1
either	1
by	1
threats	1
or	1
deeds	1
my	1
baby	1
cannot	1
judge	1
yet	1
for	1
himself	1
but	1
i	1
his	1
mother	1
can	1
foresee	1
that	1
should	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
him	1
to	1
survive	1
to	1
man	1
s	1
estate	1

would	1
willingly	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
mother	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
i	1
do	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
purchase	1
his	1
life	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
price	1
did	1
i	1
he	1
would	1
execrate	1
my	1
memory	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
rokoff	1
was	1
now	1
thoroughly	1
angered	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
failure	1
to	1
reduce	1
the	1
girl	1
to	1
terror	1
he	1
felt	1
only	1
hate	1
for	1
her	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
diseased	1
mind	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
force	1
her	1
to	1
accede	1
to	1
his	1
demands	1
as	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
s	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
revenge	1
would	1
be	1
filled	1
to	1
brimming	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
flaunt	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
in	1
the	1
capitals	1
of	1
europe	1
as	1
his	1
mistress	1
again	1
he	1
stepped	1
closer	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
evil	1
face	1
was	1
convulsed	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
desire	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
he	1
sprang	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
strong	1
fingers	1
at	1
her	1
throat	1
forced	1
her	1
backward	1
upon	1
the	1
berth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
opened	1
noisily	1
rokoff	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
turning	1
faced	1
the	1
swede	1
cook	1
into	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
usually	1
foxy	1
eyes	1
had	1
come	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
utter	1
stupidity	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
drooped	1
in	1
vacuous	1
harmony	1
he	1
busied	1
himself	1
in	1
arranging	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
s	1
meal	1
upon	1
the	1
tiny	1
table	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
cabin	1
the	1
russian	1
glared	1
at	1
him	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
he	1
cried	1
by	1
entering	1
here	1
without	1
permission	1
get	1
out	1
the	1
cook	1
turned	1
his	1
watery	1
blue	1
eyes	1
upon	1
rokoff	1
and	1
smiled	1
vacuously	1
ay	1
tank	1
it	1
blow	1
purty	1
soon	1
purty	1
hard	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
began	1
rearranging	1
the	1
few	1
dishes	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
here	1
or	1
i	1
ll	1
throw	1
you	1
out	1

miserable	1
blockhead	1
roared	1
rokoff	1
taking	1
a	1
threatening	1
step	1
toward	1
the	1
swede	1
anderssen	1
continued	1
to	1
smile	1
foolishly	1
in	1
his	1
direction	1
but	1
one	1
ham	1
like	1
paw	1
slid	1
stealthily	1
to	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
slim	1
knife	1
that	1
protruded	1
from	1
the	1
greasy	1
cord	1
supporting	1
his	1
soiled	1
apron	1
rokoff	1
saw	1
the	1
move	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
his	1
advance	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
toward	1
jane	1
clayton	1
i	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
until	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
reconsider	1
your	1
answer	1
to	1
my	1
offer	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
sent	1
ashore	1
upon	1
one	1
pretext	1
or	1
another	1
except	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
child	1

and	1
myself	1
then	1
without	1
interruption	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
french	1
that	1
the	1
cook	1
might	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
sinister	1
portent	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
he	1
banged	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
without	1
another	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
sorry	1
work	1
when	1

gone	1

turned	1
toward	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
the	1
idiotic	1
expression	1
that	1
had	1
masked	1
his	1
thoughts	1
had	1
fallen	1
away	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
place	1
was	1

said	1
and	1
you	1
heard	1
what	1

to	1

said	1

purty	1
soon	1
purty	1
hard	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
cabin	1
though	1
jane	1
clayton	1
doubted	1
the	1
cook	1
s	1
ability	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
material	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
nevertheless	1
deeply	1
grateful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
already	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
among	1
these	1
enemies	1
she	1
had	1
one	1
friend	1
brought	1
the	1
first	1
ray	1
of	1
comfort	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
her	1
miserable	1
apprehensions	1
throughout	1
the	1
long	1
voyage	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
rokoff	1
that	1
day	1
nor	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
until	1
sven	1
came	1
with	1
her	1
evening	1
meal	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
into	1
conversation	1
relative	1
to	1
his	1
plans	1
to	1
aid	1
her	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
stereotyped	1
prophecy	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
future	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
he	1
seemed	1
suddenly	1
to	1
have	1
relapsed	1
into	1
his	1
wonted	1
state	1
of	1
dense	1
stupidity	1
however	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
her	1
cabin	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
with	1
the	1
empty	1
dishes	1
he	1
whispered	1
very	1
low	1
leave	1
on	1
your	1
clothes	1
an	1
roll	1
up	1
your	1
blankets	1
ay	1
come	1
back	1
after	1
you	1

soon	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
slipped	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
at	1
once	1
but	1
jane	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
sleeve	1
my	1

asked	1
i	1

when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
jane	1
clayton	1
sank	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
berth	1
in	1
utter	1
bewilderment	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
to	1
do	1
suspicions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
swede	1
swarmed	1
her	1
brain	1
might	1
she	1
not	1
be	1
infinitely	1
worse	1
off	1
if	1
she	1
gave	1
herself	1
into	1
his	1
power	1
than	1
she	1
already	1
was	1
no	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
worse	1
off	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
than	1
with	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
at	1
least	1
bore	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
gentleman	1
she	1
swore	1
a	1
dozen	1
times	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
kincaid	1
without	1
her	1
baby	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
remained	1
clothed	1
long	1
past	1
her	1
usual	1
hour	1
for	1
retiring	1
and	1
her	1
blankets	1
were	1
neatly	1
rolled	1
and	1
bound	1
with	1
stout	1
cord	1
when	1
about	1
midnight	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
stealthy	1
scratching	1
upon	1
the	1
panels	1
of	1
her	1
door	1
swiftly	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
bolt	1
softly	1
the	1
door	1
swung	1
open	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
muffled	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
swede	1
on	1
one	1
arm	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
bundle	1
evidently	1
his	1
blankets	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
was	1
raised	1
in	1
a	1
gesture	1
commanding	1
silence	1
a	1
grimy	1
forefinger	1
upon	1
his	1
lips	1
he	1
came	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
carry	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
some	1
noise	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
it	1
it	1
ban	1
your	1
kid	1
quick	1
hands	1
snatched	1
the	1
bundle	1
from	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
hungry	1
mother	1
arms	1
folded	1
the	1
sleeping	1
infant	1
to	1
her	1
breast	1
while	1
hot	1
tears	1
of	1
joy	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
cheeks	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
frame	1

outside	1
the	1

his	1
own	1
as	1

then	1
he	1
led	1
her	1
to	1
the	1

her	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1

she	1
climbed	1
to	1
the	1

bending	1

pulling	1
toward	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1

rowed	1
on	1
as	1

quite	1
sure	1
of	1
his	1

when	1
after	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1

broke	1
through	1

she	1

not	1

that	1
in	1

he	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
rowed	1
up	1
this	1
very	1
stream	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
bartered	1
with	1
the	1
natives	1
for	1
such	1
provisions	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
sale	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
there	1
arranged	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
plan	1
for	1
the	1
adventure	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
setting	1
forth	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
full	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
river	1
was	1
quite	1
dark	1
the	1
giant	1
trees	1
overhung	1
its	1
narrow	1
banks	1
meeting	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
arch	1
above	1

dropped	1
from	1
the	1
gracefully	1
bending	1

enormous	1
creepers	1
clambered	1
in	1
riotous	1
profusion	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
loftiest	1
branch	1
falling	1
in	1
curving	1
loops	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
s	1
placid	1
breast	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1

be	1
suddenly	1
broken	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
huge	1
crocodile	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
splashing	1
of	1
the	1
oars	1

snorting	1
and	1
blowing	1
a	1

dive	1
from	1
a	1
sandy	1

to	1
the	1

safe	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
bottom	1
from	1
the	1
dense	1
jungles	1
upon	1
either	1

came	1
the	1
weird	1
night	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
carnivora	1
the	1
maniacal	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
hyena	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
panther	1
the	1
deep	1

awful	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
strange	1
uncanny	1
notes	1
that	1
the	1
girl	1
could	1
not	1
ascribe	1
to	1
any	1
particular	1
night	1
prowler	1
more	1
terrible	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
mystery	1
huddled	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
she	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
baby	1
strained	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
bosom	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
tender	1
helpless	1
thing	1
she	1
was	1
happier	1
tonight	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
sorrow	1
ridden	1
day	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
to	1
what	1
fate	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
or	1
how	1
soon	1
that	1
fate	1
might	1
overtake	1
her	1
still	1
was	1
she	1
happy	1
and	1
thankful	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
however	1
brief	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
press	1
her	1
baby	1
tightly	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
she	1
could	1
scarce	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
look	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
bright	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
black	1
eyed	1
jack	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
strain	1
her	1
eyes	1
through	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
night	1
to	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
tiny	1
peep	1
at	1
those	1
beloved	1
features	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
dim	1
outline	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
face	1
rewarded	1
her	1
efforts	1
then	1
once	1
more	1
she	1
would	1
cuddle	1
the	1
warm	1
little	1
bundle	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
close	1
to	1
three	1
o	1
clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
anderssen	1
brought	1
the	1
boat	1
s	1
nose	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
before	1
a	1
clearing	1
where	1
could	1
be	1
dimly	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
waning	1
moonlight	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
native	1
huts	1
encircled	1
by	1
a	1
thorn	1
boma	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
they	1
were	1
admitted	1
by	1
a	1
native	1
woman	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
whom	1
anderssen	1
had	1
paid	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
she	1
took	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
hut	1
but	1
anderssen	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
sleep	1
without	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
duty	1
having	1
been	1
completed	1
she	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
devices	1
the	1
swede	1
after	1
explaining	1
in	1
his	1
gruff	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
huts	1
were	1
doubtless	1
filthy	1
and	1
vermin	1
ridden	1
spread	1
jane	1
s	1
blankets	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
unrolled	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
the	1
girl	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
comfortable	1
position	1
upon	1
the	1
hard	1
ground	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
her	1
arm	1
she	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
from	1
utter	1
exhaustion	1
when	1
she	1
awoke	1
it	1
was	1
broad	1
daylight	1
about	1
her	1
were	1
clustered	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
curious	1
natives	1
mostly	1
men	1
for	1
among	1
the	1
aborigines	1

is	1
the	1
male	1
who	1
owns	1
this	1
characteristic	1
in	1
its	1
most	1
exaggerated	1
form	1
instinctively	1
jane	1
clayton	1
drew	1
the	1
baby	1
more	1
closely	1
to	1
her	1
though	1
she	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
intending	1
her	1
or	1
the	1
child	1
any	1
harm	1
in	1
fact	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
offered	1
her	1
a	1
gourd	1
of	1
milk	1
a	1
filthy	1
smoke	1
begrimed	1
gourd	1
with	1
the	1
ancient	1
rind	1
of	1
long	1
curdled	1
milk	1
caked	1
in	1
layers	1
within	1
its	1
neck	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
giver	1
touched	1
her	1
deeply	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
lightened	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
almost	1
forgotten	1
smiles	1
of	1
radiance	1
that	1
had	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
beauty	1
famous	1
both	1
in	1
baltimore	1
and	1
london	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
gourd	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
cause	1
the	1
giver	1
pain	1
raised	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
though	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
could	1
scarce	1
restrain	1
the	1
qualm	1
of	1
nausea	1
that	1
surged	1
through	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
malodorous	1
thing	1
approached	1
her	1
nostrils	1
it	1
was	1
anderssen	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
rescue	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
gourd	1
from	1
her	1
drank	1
a	1
portion	1
himself	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
native	1
with	1
a	1
gift	1
of	1
blue	1
beads	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
brightly	1
now	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
baby	1
still	1
slept	1
jane	1
could	1
scarce	1
restrain	1
her	1
impatient	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
brief	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
beloved	1
face	1
the	1
natives	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
at	1
a	1
command	1
from	1
their	1
chief	1
who	1
now	1
stood	1
talking	1
with	1
anderssen	1
a	1
little	1
apart	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
debated	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
risking	1
disturbing	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
slumber	1
by	1
lifting	1
the	1
blanket	1
that	1
now	1
protected	1
its	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
she	1
noted	1
that	1
the	1
cook	1
conversed	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
negro	1
what	1
a	1
remarkable	1
man	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
indeed	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
him	1
ignorant	1
and	1
stupid	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
now	1
within	1
the	1
past	1
twenty	1
four	1
hours	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
not	1
only	1
english	1
but	1
french	1
as	1
well	1
and	1
the	1
primitive	1
dialect	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
coast	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
him	1
shifty	1
cruel	1
and	1
untrustworthy	1
yet	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
himself	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
the	1
contrary	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
it	1
scarce	1
seemed	1
credible	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
serving	1
her	1
from	1
motives	1
purely	1
chivalrous	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
deeper	1
in	1
his	1
intentions	1
and	1
plans	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
disclosed	1
she	1
wondered	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
close	1
set	1
shifty	1
eyes	1
and	1
repulsive	1
features	1
she	1
shuddered	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
lofty	1
characteristics	1
could	1
be	1
hid	1
behind	1
so	1
foul	1
an	1
exterior	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
while	1
she	1
debated	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
uncovering	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
face	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
little	1
grunt	1
from	1
the	1
wee	1
bundle	1
in	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
gurgling	1
coo	1
that	1
set	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
raptures	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
awake	1
now	1
she	1
might	1
feast	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
quickly	1
she	1
snatched	1
the	1
blanket	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
infant	1
s	1
face	1
anderssen	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
stagger	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
holding	1
the	1
baby	1
at	1
arm	1
s	1
length	1
from	1
her	1
her	1
eyes	1
glued	1
in	1
horror	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
chubby	1
face	1
and	1
twinkling	1
eyes	1
then	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
piteous	1
cry	1
as	1
her	1
knees	1
gave	1
beneath	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
sank	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
a	1
swoon	1

the	1

as	1
the	1

that	1
had	1

in	1

the	1

to	1
have	1
his	1

launch	1
their	1
missiles	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
issuing	1
the	1
command	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
strayed	1
beyond	1

following	1
the	1
gaze	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1

with	1
a	1
yell	1
of	1
terror	1
the	1

turned	1

fled	1
toward	1
the	1

as	1
his	1
people	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
the	1

fright	1
they	1
too	1

to	1

out	1

in	1
answer	1

after	1

of	1

of	1

went	1
down	1
to	1
bloody	1
death	1
others	1
were	1
dragged	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
flight	1

it	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
the	1

was	1
empty	1

the	1

of	1
the	1
blacks	1
had	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1

that	1
tarzan	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
savage	1
pack	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
discovered	1
to	1
his	1
chagrin	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
not	1
even	1

that	1
held	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
stake	1
in	1

in	1

happen	1
the	1
blacks	1
might	1
return	1
in	1
force	1
to	1
regain	1
their	1
village	1
the	1
whites	1
might	1
readily	1
pick	1
them	1
all	1
off	1
with	1
their	1
rifles	1
from	1
the	1
surrounding	1
trees	1
he	1
might	1
even	1
starve	1
to	1
death	1
before	1
the	1
dull	1
witted	1
apes	1
realized	1
that	1

gnaw	1
through	1
his	1
bonds	1
as	1
for	1
sheeta	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
understood	1
even	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
apes	1
but	1
yet	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
marvel	1
at	1
the	1
remarkable	1
characteristics	1
this	1
beast	1
had	1
evidenced	1
that	1
it	1
felt	1
real	1
affection	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
seemed	1
little	1
doubt	1
for	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
disposed	1
of	1
it	1
walked	1
slowly	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
about	1
the	1
stake	1
rubbing	1
its	1
sides	1
against	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
legs	1
and	1
purring	1
like	1
a	1
contented	1
tabby	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
volition	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
to	1
his	1
rescue	1
tarzan	1
could	1
not	1
doubt	1
his	1
sheeta	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
jewel	1
among	1
beasts	1
mugambi	1
s	1
absence	1
worried	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
learn	1
from	1
akut	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
fearing	1
that	1
the	1
beasts	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
restraint	1
of	1
tarzan	1
s	1
presence	1
might	1
have	1
fallen	1
upon	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
devoured	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
questions	1
the	1
great	1
ape	1
but	1
pointed	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
the	1
night	1
passed	1
with	1
tarzan	1
still	1
fast	1
bound	1
to	1
the	1
stake	1
and	1
shortly	1
after	1
dawn	1
his	1
fears	1
were	1
realized	1
in	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
naked	1
black	1
figures	1
moving	1
stealthily	1
just	1
within	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
about	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
returning	1
with	1
daylight	1
their	1
courage	1
would	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
demands	1
of	1
a	1
charge	1
upon	1
the	1
handful	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
had	1
routed	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
rightful	1
abodes	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
encounter	1
seemed	1
foregone	1
if	1
the	1
savages	1
could	1
curb	1
their	1
superstitious	1
terror	1
for	1
against	1
their	1
overwhelming	1
numbers	1
their	1
long	1
spears	1
and	1
poisoned	1
arrows	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
survive	1
a	1
really	1
determined	1
attack	1
that	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
preparing	1
for	1
a	1
charge	1
became	1
apparent	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
when	1
they	1
commenced	1
to	1
show	1
themselves	1
in	1
force	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
clearing	1
dancing	1
and	1
jumping	1
about	1
as	1
they	1
waved	1
their	1
spears	1
and	1
shouted	1
taunts	1
and	1
fierce	1
warcries	1
toward	1
the	1
village	1
these	1
manoeuvres	1
tarzan	1
knew	1
would	1
continue	1
until	1
the	1
blacks	1
had	1
worked	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
hysterical	1
courage	1
sufficient	1
to	1
sustain	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
charge	1
toward	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
doubted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
reach	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
attempt	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
or	1
the	1
third	1
they	1
would	1
swarm	1
through	1
the	1
gateway	1
when	1
the	1
outcome	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
aught	1
than	1
the	1
extermination	1
of	1
tarzan	1
s	1
bold	1
but	1
unarmed	1
and	1
undisciplined	1
defenders	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
guessed	1
the	1
first	1
charge	1
carried	1
the	1
howling	1
warriors	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
a	1
shrill	1
weird	1
challenge	1
from	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
being	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
scurrying	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
bush	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
they	1
pranced	1
and	1
yelled	1
their	1
courage	1
to	1
the	1
sticking	1
point	1
and	1
again	1
essayed	1
a	1
charge	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
came	1
quite	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
but	1
when	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
hideous	1
apes	1
leaped	1
among	1
them	1
they	1
turned	1
screaming	1
in	1
terror	1
and	1
again	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
jungle	1
again	1
was	1
the	1
dancing	1
and	1
shouting	1
repeated	1
this	1
time	1
tarzan	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
would	1
enter	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
complete	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
determined	1
white	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
carried	1
to	1
a	1
successful	1
conclusion	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
attempt	1
to	1
have	1
rescue	1
come	1
so	1
close	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
his	1
poor	1
savage	1
friends	1
understand	1
precisely	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
most	1
irritating	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
place	1
blame	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
their	1
best	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
they	1
would	1
doubtless	1
remain	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
fruitless	1
effort	1
to	1
defend	1
him	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
already	1
preparing	1
for	1
the	1
charge	1
a	1
few	1
individuals	1
had	1
advanced	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
toward	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
were	1
exhorting	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
whole	1
savage	1
horde	1
would	1
be	1
racing	1
across	1
the	1
clearing	1
tarzan	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
child	1
somewhere	1
in	1
this	1
cruel	1
relentless	1
wilderness	1
his	1
heart	1
ached	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
no	1
longer	1
seek	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
realization	1
of	1
jane	1
s	1
suffering	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
weighed	1
upon	1
his	1
brave	1
spirit	1
in	1
these	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
his	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
life	1
succour	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hope	1
for	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
his	1
extremity	1
and	1
failed	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
further	1
for	1
which	1
to	1
hope	1
the	1
blacks	1
were	1
half	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
clearing	1
when	1
tarzan	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
glaring	1
toward	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
huts	1
tarzan	1
followed	1
his	1
gaze	1
to	1
his	1
infinite	1
relief	1
and	1
delight	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
stalwart	1
form	1
of	1
mugambi	1
racing	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
huge	1
black	1
was	1
panting	1
heavily	1
as	1
though	1
from	1
strenuous	1
physical	1
exertion	1
and	1
nervous	1
excitement	1
he	1
rushed	1
to	1
tarzan	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
the	1
native	1
s	1
knife	1
severed	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
cords	1
that	1
bound	1
tarzan	1
to	1
the	1
stake	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
lay	1
the	1
corpses	1
of	1
the	1
savages	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
before	1
the	1
pack	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
tarzan	1
seized	1
a	1
spear	1
and	1
knob	1
stick	1
and	1
with	1
mugambi	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
snarling	1
pack	1
about	1
him	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
natives	1
as	1
they	1
poured	1
through	1
the	1
gate	1
fierce	1
and	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
battle	1
that	1
ensued	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
savages	1
were	1
routed	1
more	1
by	1
terror	1
perhaps	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
black	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
fighting	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
huge	1
fierce	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
than	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
inability	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
relatively	1
small	1
force	1
that	1
opposed	1
them	1
one	1
prisoner	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
tarzan	1
and	1
him	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
questioned	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
rokoff	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
promised	1
his	1
liberty	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
information	1
the	1
black	1
told	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
concerning	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
their	1
chief	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
the	1
whites	1
to	1
return	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
guns	1
destroy	1
the	1
ferocious	1
pack	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
rokoff	1
appeared	1
to	1
entertain	1
even	1
more	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
strange	1
companions	1
than	1
even	1
the	1
blacks	1
themselves	1
upon	1
no	1
conditions	1
would	1
he	1
consent	1
to	1
returning	1
even	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
instead	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
party	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
where	1
they	1
stole	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
canoes	1
the	1
blacks	1
had	1
hidden	1
there	1
the	1
last	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
paddling	1
strongly	1
up	1
stream	1
their	1
porters	1
from	1
kaviri	1
s	1
village	1
wielding	1
the	1
blades	1
so	1
once	1
more	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
with	1
his	1
hideous	1
pack	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
abductor	1
for	1
weary	1
days	1
they	1
followed	1
through	1
an	1
almost	1
uninhabited	1
country	1
only	1
to	1
learn	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
wrong	1
trail	1
the	1
little	1
band	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
by	1
three	1
for	1
three	1
of	1
akut	1
s	1
apes	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
fighting	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
now	1
with	1
akut	1
there	1
were	1
five	1
great	1
apes	1
and	1
sheeta	1
was	1
there	1
and	1
mugambi	1
and	1
tarzan	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
no	1
longer	1
heard	1
rumors	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
who	1
had	1
preceded	1
rokoff	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
who	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
were	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
his	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
hot	1
upon	1
the	1
trail	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
rokoff	1
would	1
be	1
following	1
this	1
trio	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
felt	1
confident	1
that	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
keep	1
upon	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
trail	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
winning	1
so	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
might	1
snatch	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
dangers	1
and	1
horrors	1
that	1
menaced	1
him	1
in	1
retracing	1
their	1
way	1
after	1
losing	1
rokoff	1
s	1
trail	1
tarzan	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
at	1
a	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
russian	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
brush	1
in	1
a	1
northerly	1
direction	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
account	1
for	1
this	1
change	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
now	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
nowhere	1
along	1
the	1
way	1
however	1
could	1
he	1
gain	1
definite	1
information	1
that	1
might	1
assure	1
him	1
positively	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
native	1
they	1
questioned	1
had	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
other	1
party	1
though	1
nearly	1
all	1
had	1
had	1
direct	1
experience	1
with	1
the	1
russian	1
or	1
had	1
talked	1
with	1
others	1
who	1
had	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
tarzan	1
could	1
find	1
means	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
the	1
natives	1
as	1
the	1
moment	1
their	1
eyes	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
companions	1
they	1
fled	1
precipitately	1
into	1
the	1
bush	1
his	1
only	1
alternative	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
ahead	1
of	1
his	1
pack	1
and	1
waylay	1
an	1
occasional	1
warrior	1
whom	1
he	1
found	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
one	1
day	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
thus	1
engaged	1
tracking	1
an	1
unsuspecting	1
savage	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
hurling	1
a	1
spear	1
at	1
a	1
wounded	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
crouched	1
in	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
bush	1
at	1
the	1
trail	1
s	1
side	1
the	1
white	1
was	1
one	1
whom	1
tarzan	1
had	1
often	1
seen	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
recognized	1
at	1
once	1
deep	1
in	1
his	1
memory	1
was	1
implanted	1
those	1
repulsive	1
features	1
the	1
close	1
set	1
eyes	1
the	1
shifty	1
expression	1
the	1
drooping	1
yellow	1
moustache	1
instantly	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
that	1
this	1
fellow	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
accompanied	1
rokoff	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
tarzan	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
this	1
fellow	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
there	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
explanation	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
with	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
been	1
jane	1
clayton	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
now	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
words	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
face	1
went	1
white	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
pasty	1
vice	1
marked	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
swede	1
across	1
tarzan	1
s	1
forehead	1
stood	1
out	1
the	1

something	1
in	1

of	1
the	1
truth	1

his	1
assertions	1
more	1
weighty	1
than	1
anything	1

seemed	1
more	1

frightened	1

s	1
threats	1
had	1
little	1
effect	1
upon	1
him	1

it	1
was	1
quite	1
apparent	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
the	1

to	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1

not	1
to	1
wrong	1

through	1

the	1
ugambi	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
river	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
was	1
growing	1
narrow	1
and	1
swift	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
judged	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
navigable	1
even	1
for	1
canoes	1
to	1
any	1
great	1
distance	1
farther	1
toward	1
its	1
source	1
however	1
if	1
rokoff	1
had	1
not	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
in	1
what	1
direction	1
had	1
he	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
anderssen	1
s	1
flight	1
with	1
jane	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
tarzan	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
purposed	1
attempting	1
the	1
tremendous	1
feat	1
of	1
crossing	1
the	1
continent	1
to	1
zanzibar	1
but	1
whether	1
rokoff	1
would	1
dare	1
so	1
dangerous	1
a	1
journey	1
or	1
not	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
fear	1
might	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
attempt	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
horrible	1
pack	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
trail	1
and	1
that	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
was	1
following	1
him	1
to	1
wreak	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
vengeance	1
that	1
he	1
deserved	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
determined	1
to	1
continue	1
toward	1
the	1
northeast	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
direction	1
of	1
german	1
east	1
africa	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
natives	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
gain	1
information	1
as	1
to	1
rokoff	1
s	1
whereabouts	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
following	1
the	1
cessation	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
tarzan	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
native	1
village	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
which	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
bush	1
the	1
instant	1
their	1
eyes	1
fell	1
upon	1
him	1
tarzan	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
in	1
any	1
such	1
manner	1
as	1
this	1
pursued	1
them	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
chase	1
caught	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
warrior	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
so	1
badly	1
frightened	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
dropping	1
his	1
weapons	1
and	1
falling	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
wide	1
eyed	1
and	1
screaming	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
on	1
his	1
captor	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
considerable	1
difficulty	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
quieted	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
fears	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
coherent	1
statement	1
from	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
uncalled	1
for	1
terror	1
from	1
him	1
tarzan	1
learned	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
much	1
coaxing	1
that	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
whites	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
these	1
men	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
white	1
devil	1
that	1
pursued	1
them	1
warning	1
the	1
natives	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
frightful	1
pack	1
of	1
demons	1
that	1
accompanied	1
it	1
the	1
black	1
had	1
recognized	1
tarzan	1
as	1
the	1
white	1

the	1
descriptions	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
whites	1
and	1
their	1
black	1
servants	1
behind	1
him	1

expected	1
to	1

a	1
horde	1
of	1
demons	1
disguised	1
as	1
apes	1

attempting	1
to	1
make	1
travel	1
as	1
difficult	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
turning	1
the	1
natives	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
superstitious	1
fear	1
the	1
native	1
further	1
told	1
tarzan	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
led	1
the	1
recent	1
expedition	1
had	1
promised	1
them	1
a	1
fabulous	1
reward	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
kill	1
the	1
white	1
devil	1
this	1
they	1
had	1
fully	1
intended	1
doing	1
should	1
the	1
opportunity	1
present	1
itself	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
tarzan	1
their	1
blood	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
water	1
as	1

recovered	1
his	1
grasp	1
upon	1
his	1
courage	1
and	1
at	1
tarzan	1
s	1
suggestion	1
accompanied	1
the	1

back	1
to	1
the	1
village	1

went	1
for	1

to	1

answer	1
his	1
questions	1
one	1
by	1
one	1

straggled	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
but	1
that	1
their	1
fears	1
were	1
not	1
entirely	1
allayed	1
was	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
white	1
that	1
showed	1
about	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
cast	1
constant	1
and	1
apprehensive	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1

the	1

among	1
the	1
first	1
to	1

to	1

and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
tarzan	1
was	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
interview	1
he	1
lost	1
no	1

in	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
palaver	1
with	1

black	1

short	1
and	1
stout	1
with	1
an	1
unusually	1
low	1
and	1
degraded	1
countenance	1
and	1
apelike	1
arms	1
his	1
whole	1
expression	1
denoted	1
deceitfulness	1
only	1
the	1
superstitious	1
terror	1
engendered	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
stories	1
poured	1
into	1
his	1
ears	1
by	1
the	1
whites	1
and	1
blacks	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
party	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
leaping	1
upon	1
tarzan	1
with	1
his	1
warriors	1
and	1
slaying	1
him	1
forthwith	1
for	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
were	1
inveterate	1
maneaters	1
but	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
indeed	1
be	1
a	1
devil	1
and	1
that	1
out	1
there	1
in	1

from	1
putting	1
his	1
desires	1
into	1
action	1

questioned	1
the	1
fellow	1
closely	1
and	1
by	1
comparing	1
his	1
statements	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
warrior	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
talked	1
with	1

of	1

already	1
deserted	1
him	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
village	1

had	1
hanged	1
five	1
for	1
theft	1
and	1
attempted	1
desertion	1
judging	1
however	1
from	1
what	1
the	1
waganwazam	1
had	1
learned	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
blacks	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
too	1
far	1
gone	1
in	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
brutal	1
rokoff	1
to	1
fear	1
even	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
their	1
plans	1
it	1
was	1
apparent	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
travel	1
any	1
great	1
distance	1
before	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
his	1
porters	1
cooks	1
tent	1
boys	1
gun	1
bearers	1

and	1
even	1
his	1
headman	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
bush	1
leaving	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
merciless	1
jungle	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
denied	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
white	1
woman	1
or	1
child	1
with	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
whites	1
but	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
tarzan	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
lied	1
several	1
times	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
approached	1
the	1
subject	1
from	1
different	1
angles	1
but	1
never	1
was	1
he	1
successful	1
in	1
surprising	1
the	1
wily	1
cannibal	1
into	1
a	1
direct	1
contradiction	1
of	1
his	1
original	1
statement	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
women	1
or	1
children	1
with	1
the	1
party	1
tarzan	1
demanded	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
after	1
considerable	1
haggling	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
succeeded	1
in	1
obtaining	1
a	1
meal	1
he	1
then	1
tried	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
especially	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
captured	1
in	1
the	1
bush	1
but	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
s	1
presence	1
sealed	1
their	1
lips	1
at	1
last	1
convinced	1
that	1
these	1
people	1
knew	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
jane	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
tarzan	1
determined	1
to	1
remain	1
overnight	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
discovering	1
something	1
further	1
of	1
importance	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
stated	1
his	1
decision	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
surprised	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
from	1
apparent	1
dislike	1
and	1
suspicion	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
became	1
a	1
most	1
eager	1
and	1
solicitous	1
host	1
nothing	1
would	1
do	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
should	1
occupy	1
the	1
best	1
hut	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
from	1
which	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
s	1
oldest	1
wife	1
was	1
forthwith	1
summarily	1
ejected	1
while	1
the	1
chief	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
temporary	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
younger	1
consorts	1
had	1
tarzan	1
chanced	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
princely	1
reward	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
the	1
blacks	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
succeed	1
in	1
killing	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
more	1
quickly	1
interpreted	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
s	1
sudden	1
change	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
white	1
giant	1
sleeping	1
peacefully	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
huts	1
would	1
greatly	1
facilitate	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
earning	1
the	1
reward	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
chief	1
was	1
urgent	1
in	1
his	1
suggestions	1
that	1
tarzan	1
doubtless	1
being	1
very	1
much	1
fatigued	1
after	1
his	1
travels	1
should	1
retire	1
early	1
to	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
the	1
anything	1
but	1
inviting	1
palace	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
detested	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
sleeping	1
within	1
a	1
native	1
hut	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
this	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
induce	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
chat	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
filled	1
dwelling	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
draw	1
the	1
truths	1
he	1
sought	1
so	1
tarzan	1
accepted	1
the	1
invitation	1
of	1
old	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
insisting	1
however	1
that	1
he	1
much	1
preferred	1
sharing	1
a	1
hut	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
rather	1
than	1
driving	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
old	1
wife	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
the	1
toothless	1
old	1
hag	1
grinned	1
her	1
appreciation	1
of	1
this	1
suggestion	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
plan	1
still	1
better	1
suited	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
scheme	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
surround	1
tarzan	1
with	1
a	1
gang	1
of	1
picked	1
assassins	1
he	1
readily	1
assented	1
so	1
that	1
presently	1
tarzan	1
had	1
been	1
installed	1
in	1
a	1
hut	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
gate	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
dance	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
recently	1
returned	1
hunters	1
tarzan	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
as	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
explained	1
having	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
festivities	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
safely	1
installed	1
in	1
the	1
trap	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
called	1
about	1
him	1
the	1
young	1
warriors	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
selected	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
devil	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
overly	1
enthusiastic	1
about	1
the	1
plan	1
since	1
deep	1
in	1
their	1
superstitious	1
hearts	1
lay	1
an	1
exaggerated	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
white	1
giant	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
was	1
law	1
among	1
his	1
people	1
so	1
not	1
one	1
dared	1
refuse	1
the	1
duty	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
perform	1
as	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
unfolded	1
his	1
plan	1
in	1
whispers	1
to	1
the	1
savages	1
squatting	1
about	1
him	1
the	1
old	1
toothless	1
hag	1
to	1
whom	1
tarzan	1
had	1
saved	1
her	1
hut	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
hovered	1
about	1
the	1
conspirators	1
ostensibly	1
to	1
replenish	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
firewood	1
for	1
the	1
blaze	1
about	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
sat	1
but	1
really	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
as	1
possible	1
tarzan	1
had	1
slept	1
for	1
perhaps	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
two	1
despite	1
the	1
savage	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
revellers	1
when	1
his	1
keen	1
senses	1
came	1
suddenly	1
alert	1
to	1
a	1
suspiciously	1
stealthy	1
movement	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lay	1
the	1
fire	1
had	1
died	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1
glowing	1
embers	1
which	1
accentuated	1
rather	1
than	1
relieved	1
the	1
darkness	1
that	1
shrouded	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
smelling	1
dwelling	1
yet	1
the	1
trained	1
senses	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
warned	1
him	1
of	1
another	1
presence	1
creeping	1
almost	1
silently	1
toward	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
he	1
doubted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hut	1
mates	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
festivities	1
for	1
he	1
still	1
heard	1
the	1
wild	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
dancers	1
and	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
tom	1
toms	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
without	1
who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
took	1
such	1
pains	1
to	1
conceal	1
his	1
approach	1
as	1
the	1
presence	1
came	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
bounded	1
lightly	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
his	1
spear	1
poised	1
ready	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
he	1
asked	1
that	1
creeps	1
upon	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
like	1
a	1
hungry	1
lion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
silence	1
bwana	1
replied	1
an	1
old	1
cracked	1
voice	1
it	1
is	1
tambudza	1
she	1
whose	1
hut	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
and	1
thus	1
drive	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
cold	1
night	1
what	1
does	1
tambudza	1
want	1
of	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
asked	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
you	1
were	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
whom	1
none	1
is	1
now	1
kind	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
warn	1
you	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
your	1
kindness	1
answered	1
the	1
old	1
hag	1
warn	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
has	1
chosen	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
with	1
you	1
replied	1
tambudza	1
i	1
was	1
near	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
issuing	1
his	1
instructions	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
dance	1
is	1
run	1
well	1
into	1
the	1
morning	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hut	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
awake	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
pretend	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
sleep	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
sleep	1
it	1
is	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
s	1
command	1
that	1
you	1
be	1
killed	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
then	1
asleep	1
they	1
will	1
wait	1
quietly	1
beside	1
you	1
until	1
you	1
do	1
sleep	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
will	1
all	1
fall	1
upon	1
you	1
together	1
and	1
slay	1
you	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
is	1
determined	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
reward	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
has	1
offered	1
i	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
reward	1
said	1
tarzan	1
half	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
added	1
how	1
may	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
hope	1
to	1
collect	1
the	1
reward	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
my	1
enemies	1
have	1
left	1
his	1
country	1
and	1
gone	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
where	1
oh	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
replied	1
tambudza	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
knows	1
where	1
they	1
camp	1
his	1
runners	1
could	1
quickly	1
overtake	1
them	1
they	1
move	1
slowly	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
asked	1
tarzan	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them	1
asked	1
tambudza	1
in	1
way	1
of	1
reply	1
tarzan	1
nodded	1
i	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
where	1
they	1
lie	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
yourself	1
but	1
i	1
could	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
them	1
bwana	1
in	1
their	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
speakers	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
little	1
figure	1
which	1
crept	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
behind	1
them	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
see	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
slunk	1
noiselessly	1
out	1
again	1
it	1
was	1
little	1
buulaoo	1
the	1
chief	1
s	1
son	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
younger	1
wives	1
a	1
vindictive	1
degenerate	1
little	1
rascal	1
who	1
hated	1
tambudza	1
and	1
was	1
ever	1
seeking	1
opportunities	1
to	1
spy	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
report	1
her	1
slightest	1
breach	1
of	1
custom	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
come	1
then	1
said	1
tarzan	1
quickly	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
this	1
buulaoo	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
legging	1
it	1
up	1
the	1
village	1
street	1
to	1
where	1
his	1
hideous	1
sire	1
guzzled	1
native	1
beer	1
and	1
watched	1
the	1
evolutions	1
of	1
the	1
frantic	1
dancers	1
leaping	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
cavorting	1
wildly	1
in	1
their	1
hysterical	1
capers	1
so	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
as	1
tarzan	1
and	1
tambudza	1
sneaked	1
warily	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
melted	1
into	1
the	1
stygian	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
two	1
lithe	1
runners	1
took	1
their	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction	1
though	1
by	1
another	1
trail	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
sufficiently	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
safe	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
speak	1
above	1
a	1
whisper	1
tarzan	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
aught	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
yes	1
bwana	1
replied	1
tambudza	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
a	1
little	1
white	1
piccaninny	1

died	1
here	1
in	1
our	1

buried	1

a	1

scoundrel	1
when	1
jane	1
clayton	1
regained	1
consciousness	1
she	1
saw	1
anderssen	1
standing	1
over	1
her	1
holding	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
as	1
her	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
them	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
horror	1
overspread	1
her	1
countenance	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
he	1
asked	1
you	1
ban	1
sick	1
where	1
is	1
my	1
baby	1
she	1
cried	1
ignoring	1
his	1
questions	1
anderssen	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
chubby	1
infant	1
but	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
she	1
said	1
you	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
mine	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
devil	1
like	1
the	1

eyes	1

in	1
surprise	1

very	1

anderssen	1
fidgeted	1
about	1
standing	1
first	1
on	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
evident	1
to	1
jane	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
honest	1
in	1
his	1
protestations	1
of	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
presently	1
the	1
baby	1
commenced	1
to	1
crow	1
and	1
bounce	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
swede	1
s	1
arms	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
leaning	1
forward	1
with	1
little	1
hands	1
out	1
reaching	1
toward	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
withstand	1
the	1
appeal	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
cry	1
she	1
sprang	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
baby	1
to	1
her	1
breast	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
wept	1
silently	1
her	1
face	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
soiled	1
little	1
dress	1
the	1
first	1
shock	1
of	1
disappointment	1
that	1
the	1
tiny	1
thing	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
her	1
beloved	1
jack	1
was	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
hope	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
some	1
miracle	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
snatch	1
her	1
baby	1
from	1
rokoff	1
s	1
hands	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
instant	1
before	1
the	1
kincaid	1
sailed	1
from	1
england	1
then	1
too	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
mute	1
appeal	1
of	1
this	1
wee	1
waif	1
alone	1
and	1
unloved	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
jungle	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
thought	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
that	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
mother	1
s	1
heart	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
innocent	1
babe	1
while	1
still	1
she	1
suffered	1
from	1
disappointment	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
deceived	1
in	1
its	1
identity	1
have	1
you	1
no	1
idea	1
whose	1
child	1
this	1
is	1
she	1
asked	1
anderssen	1
the	1
man	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
not	1
now	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
he	1
ain	1
t	1
ban	1
your	1
kid	1
ay	1
don	1
know	1
whose	1
kid	1

tank	1
so	1
too	1
what	1
do	1
we	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
now	1
ay	1
can	1
t	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
kincaid	1
rokoff	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
shot	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
back	1
ay	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
then	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
black	1
men	1
they	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
eh	1
no	1
no	1
cried	1
jane	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
would	1
rather	1
die	1
than	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
again	1
no	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
take	1
this	1
poor	1
little	1
creature	1
with	1
us	1
if	1
god	1
is	1
willing	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
so	1
they	1
again	1
took	1
up	1
their	1
flight	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
taking	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
of	1
the	1
mosulas	1
to	1
carry	1
provisions	1
and	1
the	1
tents	1
that	1
anderssen	1
had	1
smuggled	1
aboard	1
the	1
small	1
boat	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
the	1
attempted	1
escape	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
of	1
torture	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
suffered	1
were	1
so	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
long	1
unbroken	1
nightmare	1
of	1
hideousness	1
that	1
she	1
soon	1
lost	1
all	1
track	1
of	1
time	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
wandering	1
for	1
days	1
or	1
years	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
the	1
one	1
bright	1
spot	1
in	1
that	1
eternity	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
suffering	1
was	1
the	1
little	1
child	1
whose	1
tiny	1
hands	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
fastened	1
their	1
softly	1
groping	1
fingers	1
firmly	1
about	1
her	1
heart	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
the	1
little	1
thing	1
took	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
aching	1
void	1
that	1
the	1
theft	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
baby	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
course	1
but	1
yet	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
she	1
found	1
her	1
mother	1
love	1
enveloping	1
the	1
waif	1
more	1
closely	1
until	1
she	1
sometimes	1
sat	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
sweet	1
imagining	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
bundle	1
of	1
humanity	1
at	1
her	1
breast	1
was	1
truly	1
her	1
own	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
their	1
progress	1
inland	1
was	1
extremely	1
slow	1
word	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
through	1
natives	1
passing	1
from	1
the	1
coast	1
on	1
hunting	1
excursions	1
that	1
rokoff	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
guessed	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
flight	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
journey	1
as	1
light	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
gently	1
bred	1
woman	1
kept	1
anderssen	1
to	1
a	1
slow	1
advance	1
of	1
short	1
and	1
easy	1
marches	1
with	1
many	1
rests	1
the	1
swede	1
insisted	1
upon	1
carrying	1
the	1
child	1
while	1
they	1
travelled	1
and	1
in	1
countless	1
other	1
ways	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
help	1
jane	1
clayton	1
conserve	1
her	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
terribly	1
chagrined	1
on	1
discovering	1
the	1
mistake	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
but	1
once	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
became	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
motives	1
were	1
truly	1
chivalrous	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
him	1
longer	1
to	1
upbraid	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
error	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
have	1
avoided	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
each	1
day	1
s	1
march	1
anderssen	1
saw	1
to	1
the	1
erection	1
of	1
a	1
comfortable	1
shelter	1
for	1
jane	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
her	1
tent	1
was	1
always	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
favourable	1
location	1
the	1
thorn	1
boma	1
round	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
strongest	1
and	1
most	1
impregnable	1
that	1
the	1
mosula	1
could	1
construct	1
her	1
food	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
their	1
limited	1
stores	1
and	1
the	1
rifle	1
of	1
the	1
swede	1
could	1
provide	1
but	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
touched	1
her	1
heart	1
the	1
closest	1
was	1
the	1
gentle	1
consideration	1
and	1
courtesy	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
always	1
accorded	1
her	1
that	1
such	1
nobility	1
of	1
character	1
could	1
lie	1
beneath	1
so	1
repulsive	1
an	1
exterior	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
to	1
her	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
innate	1
chivalry	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
unfailing	1
kindliness	1
and	1
sympathy	1
transformed	1
his	1
appearance	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
jane	1
was	1
concerned	1
until	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
mirrored	1
in	1
his	1
countenance	1
they	1
had	1
commenced	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
progress	1
when	1
word	1
reached	1
them	1
that	1
rokoff	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
marches	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
discovered	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
flight	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
anderssen	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
purchasing	1
a	1
canoe	1
from	1
a	1
chief	1
whose	1
village	1
lay	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
ugambi	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
a	1
tributary	1
thereafter	1
the	1
little	1
party	1
of	1
fugitives	1
fled	1
up	1
the	1
broad	1
ugambi	1
and	1
so	1
rapid	1
had	1
their	1
flight	1
become	1
that	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
received	1
word	1
of	1
their	1
pursuers	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
canoe	1
navigation	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
they	1
abandoned	1
their	1
canoe	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
jungle	1
here	1
progress	1
became	1
at	1
once	1
arduous	1
slow	1
and	1
dangerous	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
after	1
leaving	1
the	1
ugambi	1
the	1
baby	1
fell	1
ill	1
with	1
fever	1
anderssen	1
knew	1
what	1
the	1
outcome	1
must	1
be	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
tell	1
jane	1
clayton	1
the	1
truth	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
child	1
almost	1
as	1
passionately	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
own	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
as	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
condition	1
precluded	1
farther	1
advance	1
anderssen	1
withdrew	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
trail	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
following	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
camp	1
in	1
a	1
natural	1
clearing	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
river	1
here	1
jane	1
devoted	1
her	1
every	1
moment	1
to	1
caring	1
for	1
the	1
tiny	1
sufferer	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
sorrow	1
and	1
anxiety	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
bear	1
a	1
further	1
blow	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
sudden	1
announcement	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mosula	1
porters	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
foraging	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
adjacent	1
that	1
rokoff	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
were	1
camped	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
upon	1
their	1
trail	1
to	1
this	1
little	1
nook	1
which	1
all	1
had	1
thought	1
so	1
excellent	1
a	1
hiding	1
place	1
this	1
information	1
could	1
mean	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
break	1
camp	1
and	1
fly	1
onward	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
condition	1
jane	1
clayton	1
knew	1
the	1
traits	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
positive	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
separate	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
child	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
recaptured	1
them	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
separation	1
would	1
mean	1
the	1
immediate	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
as	1
they	1
stumbled	1
forward	1
through	1
the	1
tangled	1
vegetation	1
along	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
almost	1
overgrown	1
game	1
trail	1
the	1
mosula	1
porters	1
deserted	1
them	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
staunch	1
enough	1
in	1
their	1
devotion	1
and	1
loyalty	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
however	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
atrocious	1
disposition	1
of	1
rokoff	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
grown	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
mortal	1
terror	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
close	1
upon	1
them	1
their	1
timid	1
hearts	1
would	1
fortify	1
them	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
they	1
deserted	1
the	1
three	1
whites	1
yet	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
went	1
anderssen	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
the	1
swede	1
went	1
ahead	1
to	1
hew	1
a	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
brush	1
where	1
the	1
path	1
was	1
entirely	1
overgrown	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
this	1
march	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
carry	1
the	1
child	1
all	1
day	1
they	1
marched	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
they	1
realized	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
failed	1
close	1
behind	1
them	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
safari	1
advancing	1
along	1
the	1
trail	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
cleared	1
for	1
their	1
pursuers	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
quite	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
overtaken	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
anderssen	1
hid	1
jane	1
behind	1
a	1
large	1
tree	1
covering	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
with	1
brush	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
village	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
farther	1
on	1

said	1

asked	1
jane	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
the	1
great	1
scoundrel	1
would	1
do	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
thwarted	1
by	1
the	1
swede	1
anderssen	1
did	1
not	1

other	1
than	1
to	1
warn	1
her	1
to	1
silence	1
and	1

along	1

they	1

then	1
ay	1
couldn	1
t	1

what	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
you	1

to	1

he	1
shoved	1
the	1
gun	1
and	1
bandoleer	1
into	1
the	1
shelter	1
beside	1
jane	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
she	1
watched	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
along	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
oncoming	1
safari	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
soon	1
a	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
trail	1
hid	1
him	1
from	1
view	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1
was	1
to	1
follow	1
with	1
the	1
rifle	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
assistance	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
further	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
terrible	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
alone	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
fearful	1
jungle	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
friend	1
to	1
aid	1
her	1
she	1
started	1
to	1
crawl	1
from	1
her	1
shelter	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
running	1
after	1
anderssen	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
as	1
she	1
drew	1
the	1
baby	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
she	1
glanced	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
little	1
face	1
how	1
red	1
it	1
was	1
how	1
unnatural	1
the	1
little	1
thing	1
looked	1
she	1
raised	1
the	1
cheek	1
to	1
hers	1
it	1
was	1
fiery	1
hot	1
with	1
fever	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
gasp	1
of	1
terror	1
jane	1
clayton	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
path	1
the	1
rifle	1
and	1
bandoleer	1
lay	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
shelter	1
beside	1
her	1
anderssen	1
was	1
forgotten	1
and	1
rokoff	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
peril	1
all	1
that	1
rioted	1
through	1
her	1
fear	1
mad	1
brain	1
was	1
the	1
fearful	1
fact	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
helpless	1
child	1
was	1
stricken	1
with	1
the	1
terrible	1
jungle	1
fever	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
helpless	1
to	1
do	1
aught	1
to	1
allay	1
its	1
sufferings	1
sufferings	1
that	1
were	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
during	1
ensuing	1
intervals	1
of	1
partial	1
consciousness	1
her	1
one	1
thought	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
one	1
who	1
could	1
help	1
her	1
some	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
children	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
came	1
recollection	1
of	1
the	1
friendly	1
village	1
of	1
which	1
anderssen	1
had	1
spoken	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
but	1
reach	1
it	1
in	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
like	1
a	1
startled	1
antelope	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
up	1
the	1
trail	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
anderssen	1
had	1
indicated	1
from	1
far	1
behind	1
came	1
the	1
sudden	1
shouting	1
of	1
men	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
shots	1
and	1
then	1
silence	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
anderssen	1
had	1
met	1
the	1
russian	1
a	1
half	1
hour	1
later	1
she	1
stumbled	1
exhausted	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
thatched	1
village	1
instantly	1
she	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
men	1
women	1
and	1
children	1
eager	1
curious	1
excited	1
natives	1
plied	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
questions	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
understand	1
or	1
answer	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
point	1
tearfully	1
at	1
the	1
baby	1
now	1
wailing	1
piteously	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
repeat	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
fever	1
fever	1
fever	1
the	1
blacks	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
her	1
words	1
but	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
trouble	1
and	1
soon	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
pulled	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
hut	1
and	1
with	1
several	1
others	1
was	1
doing	1
her	1
poor	1
best	1
to	1
quiet	1
the	1
child	1
and	1
allay	1
its	1
agony	1
the	1
witch	1
doctor	1
came	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
infant	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
boiled	1
some	1
strange	1
concoction	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
earthen	1
pot	1
making	1
weird	1
passes	1
above	1
it	1
and	1
mumbling	1
strange	1
monotonous	1
chants	1
presently	1
he	1
dipped	1
a	1
zebra	1
s	1
tail	1
into	1
the	1
brew	1
and	1
with	1
further	1
mutterings	1
and	1
incantations	1
sprinkled	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
the	1
liquid	1
over	1
the	1
baby	1
s	1
face	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
women	1
sat	1
about	1
and	1
moaned	1
and	1
wailed	1
until	1
jane	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
mad	1
but	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts	1
she	1
endured	1
the	1
frightful	1
waking	1
nightmare	1
of	1
those	1
awful	1
hours	1
in	1
dumb	1
and	1
patient	1
suffering	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
toward	1
midnight	1
that	1
she	1
became	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
commotion	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
natives	1
raised	1
in	1
controversy	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
presently	1
she	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
approaching	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
squatted	1
before	1
a	1
bright	1
fire	1
with	1
the	1
baby	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
the	1
little	1
thing	1
lay	1
very	1
still	1
now	1
its	1
lids	1
half	1
raised	1
showed	1
the	1
pupils	1
horribly	1
upturned	1
jane	1
clayton	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
face	1
with	1
fear	1
haunted	1
eyes	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
baby	1
not	1
her	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
but	1
how	1
close	1
how	1
dear	1
the	1
tiny	1
helpless	1
thing	1
had	1
become	1
to	1
her	1
her	1
heart	1
bereft	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
this	1
poor	1
little	1
nameless	1
waif	1
and	1
lavished	1
upon	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
denied	1
her	1
during	1
the	1
long	1
bitter	1
weeks	1
of	1
her	1
captivity	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
was	1
near	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
terrified	1
at	1
contemplation	1
of	1
her	1
loss	1
still	1
she	1
hoped	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
quickly	1
now	1
and	1
end	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
victim	1
the	1
footsteps	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
without	1
the	1
hut	1
now	1
halted	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whispered	1
colloquy	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
entered	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
but	1
little	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
in	1
hand	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
village	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
she	1
now	1
saw	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
appearing	1
savage	1
with	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
brutal	1
degeneracy	1
writ	1
large	1
upon	1
his	1
bestial	1
countenance	1
to	1
jane	1
clayton	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
gorilla	1
than	1
human	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
her	1
but	1
without	1
success	1
and	1
finally	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
some	1
one	1
without	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
summons	1
another	1
negro	1
entered	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
different	1
appearance	1
from	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
so	1
different	1
in	1
fact	1
that	1
jane	1
clayton	1
immediately	1
decided	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
another	1
tribe	1
this	1
man	1
acted	1
as	1
interpreter	1
and	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
question	1
that	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
put	1
to	1
her	1
jane	1
felt	1
an	1
intuitive	1
conviction	1
that	1
the	1
savage	1
was	1
attempting	1
to	1
draw	1
information	1
from	1
her	1
for	1
some	1
ulterior	1
motive	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
should	1
so	1
suddenly	1
have	1
become	1
interested	1
in	1
her	1
plans	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
her	1
intended	1
destination	1
when	1
her	1
journey	1
had	1
been	1
interrupted	1
at	1
his	1
village	1
seeing	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
withholding	1
the	1
information	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
husband	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
trip	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
negatively	1
then	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
his	1
visit	1
talking	1
through	1
the	1
interpreter	1
i	1
have	1
just	1
learned	1
he	1
said	1
from	1
some	1
men	1
who	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
water	1
that	1
your	1
husband	1
followed	1
you	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
for	1
several	1
marches	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
set	1
upon	1
by	1
natives	1
and	1
killed	1
therefore	1
i	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
this	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
not	1
waste	1
your	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
if	1
you	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
your	1
husband	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
instead	1
could	1
turn	1
and	1
retrace	1
your	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
jane	1
thanked	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
though	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
numb	1
with	1
suffering	1
at	1
this	1
new	1
blow	1
she	1
who	1
had	1
suffered	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
beyond	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
keenest	1
of	1
misery	1
s	1
pangs	1
for	1
her	1
senses	1
were	1
numbed	1
and	1
calloused	1
with	1
bowed	1
head	1
she	1
sat	1
staring	1
with	1
unseeing	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
in	1
her	1
lap	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
hut	1
sometime	1
later	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
another	1
had	1
entered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
sitting	1
opposite	1
her	1
threw	1
a	1
faggot	1
upon	1
the	1
dying	1
embers	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
between	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
flare	1
it	1
burst	1
into	1
renewed	1
flame	1
lighting	1
up	1
the	1
hut	1
s	1
interior	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
magic	1
the	1
flame	1
disclosed	1
to	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
horrified	1
gaze	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
quite	1
dead	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
a	1
choking	1
lump	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
throat	1
her	1
head	1
drooped	1
in	1
silent	1
misery	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
bundle	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
suddenly	1
to	1
her	1
breast	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
was	1
unbroken	1
then	1
the	1
native	1
woman	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
hideous	1
wail	1
a	1
man	1
coughed	1
close	1
before	1
jane	1
clayton	1
and	1
spoke	1
her	1
name	1
with	1
a	1
start	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
sardonic	1
countenance	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1

escape	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
rokoff	1
stood	1
sneering	1
down	1
upon	1
jane	1
clayton	1
then	1
his	1
eyes	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
bundle	1
in	1
her	1
lap	1
jane	1
had	1
drawn	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
blanket	1
over	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
face	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
it	1
seemed	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
sleeping	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
unnecessary	1
trouble	1
said	1
rokoff	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
this	1
village	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
attended	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
affairs	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
brought	1
it	1
here	1
myself	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
spared	1
the	1
dangers	1
and	1
fatigue	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
i	1
must	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
relieving	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
infant	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
destined	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
will	1
rear	1
him	1
carefully	1
making	1
a	1
good	1
cannibal	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
chance	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
civilization	1
it	1
will	1
doubtless	1
afford	1
you	1
much	1
food	1
for	1
thought	1
as	1
you	1
compare	1
the	1
luxuries	1
and	1
comforts	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
your	1
son	1
is	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
the	1
waganwazam	1
again	1
i	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
bringing	1
him	1
here	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
now	1
i	1
must	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
surrender	1
him	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
turn	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
foster	1
parents	1
as	1
he	1
concluded	1
rokoff	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
a	1
nasty	1
grin	1
of	1
vindictiveness	1
upon	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
jane	1
clayton	1
rose	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
protest	1
laid	1
the	1
little	1
bundle	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
she	1
said	1
thank	1
god	1
he	1
is	1
beyond	1
your	1
power	1
to	1
harm	1
grasping	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
her	1
words	1
rokoff	1
snatched	1
the	1
blanket	1
from	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
face	1
to	1
seek	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
fears	1
jane	1
clayton	1
watched	1
his	1
expression	1
closely	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
puzzled	1
for	1
days	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
identity	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
doubt	1
before	1
the	1
last	1
shred	1
of	1
that	1
doubt	1
was	1
wiped	1
away	1
as	1
she	1
witnessed	1
the	1
terrible	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
dead	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
baby	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
his	1
dearest	1
wish	1
for	1
vengeance	1
had	1
been	1
thwarted	1
by	1
a	1
higher	1
power	1
almost	1
throwing	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
back	1
into	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
arms	1
rokoff	1
stamped	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
hut	1
pounding	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fists	1
and	1
cursing	1
terribly	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
halted	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
bringing	1
his	1
face	1
down	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
you	1
are	1
laughing	1
at	1
me	1
he	1
shrieked	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
beaten	1
me	1
eh	1
i	1
ll	1
show	1
you	1
as	1
i	1
have	1
shown	1
the	1
miserable	1
ape	1
you	1
call	1
husband	1
what	1
it	1
means	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
the	1
plans	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
you	1
have	1
robbed	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
i	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
cannibal	1
chief	1
but	1
and	1
he	1
paused	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
threat	1
sink	1
deep	1
i	1
can	1
make	1
the	1
mother	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
cannibal	1
and	1
that	1
i	1
shall	1
do	1
after	1
i	1
have	1
finished	1
with	1
her	1
myself	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
wring	1
from	1
jane	1
clayton	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
terror	1
he	1
failed	1
miserably	1
she	1
was	1
beyond	1
that	1
her	1
brain	1
and	1
nerves	1
were	1
numb	1
to	1
suffering	1
and	1
shock	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
a	1
faint	1
almost	1
happy	1
smile	1
touched	1
her	1
lips	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
with	1
thankful	1
heart	1
that	1
this	1
poor	1
little	1
corpse	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
wee	1
jack	1
and	1
that	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
rokoff	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
flaunted	1
the	1
fact	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
if	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
hers	1
so	1
much	1
safer	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
real	1
jack	1
wherever	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
had	1
of	1
course	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
son	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
still	1
lived	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
possible	1
that	1
without	1
rokoff	1
s	1
knowledge	1
this	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
substituted	1
for	1
hers	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
confederates	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
now	1
her	1
son	1
might	1
be	1
safe	1
with	1
friends	1
in	1
london	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
both	1
able	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
paid	1
any	1
ransom	1
which	1
the	1
traitorous	1
conspirator	1
might	1
have	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
safe	1
release	1
of	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
s	1
son	1
she	1
had	1
thought	1
it	1
all	1
out	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
discovered	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
which	1
anderssen	1
had	1
placed	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
that	1
night	1
upon	1
the	1
kincaid	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
constant	1
and	1
gnawing	1
source	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
dream	1
the	1
whole	1
fantasy	1
through	1
in	1
its	1
every	1
detail	1
no	1
the	1
russian	1
must	1
never	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
baby	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
was	1
hopeless	1
with	1
anderssen	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
dead	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
succour	1
her	1
who	1
knew	1
where	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
rokoff	1
s	1
threat	1
she	1
realized	1
was	1
no	1
idle	1
one	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
or	1
attempt	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
sure	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
worst	1
it	1
meant	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
earlier	1
release	1
from	1
the	1
hideous	1
anguish	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
enduring	1
she	1
must	1
find	1
some	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
own	1
life	1
before	1
the	1
russian	1
could	1
harm	1
her	1
further	1
just	1
now	1
she	1
wanted	1
time	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
prepare	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
last	1
awful	1
step	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
exhausted	1
every	1
possibility	1
of	1
escape	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
live	1
unless	1
she	1
might	1
find	1
her	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
child	1
but	1
slight	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
hope	1
appeared	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
admit	1
its	1
impossibility	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
she	1
faced	1
the	1
fearful	1
reality	1
of	1
choosing	1
between	1
the	1
final	1
alternatives	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
self	1
destruction	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
go	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
russian	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
with	1
my	1
dead	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
brought	1
sufficient	1
misery	1
and	1
anguish	1
upon	1
me	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
harm	1
me	1
further	1
what	1
wrong	1
have	1
i	1
ever	1
done	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
persist	1
in	1
persecuting	1
me	1
you	1
are	1
suffering	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
monkey	1
you	1
chose	1
when	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
he	1
replied	1
but	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
in	1
discussing	1
the	1
matter	1
we	1
shall	1
bury	1
the	1
child	1
here	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
return	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
camp	1
tomorrow	1
i	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
back	1
and	1
turn	1
you	1
over	1
to	1
your	1
new	1
husband	1
the	1
lovely	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
come	1
he	1
reached	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
jane	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
her	1
feet	1
now	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
i	1
shall	1
bury	1
the	1
body	1
she	1
said	1
send	1
some	1
men	1
to	1
dig	1
a	1
grave	1
outside	1
the	1
village	1
rokoff	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
thing	1
over	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
camp	1
with	1
his	1
victim	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
her	1
apathy	1
a	1
resignation	1
to	1
her	1
fate	1
stepping	1
outside	1
the	1
hut	1
he	1
motioned	1
her	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
he	1
escorted	1
jane	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
beneath	1
a	1
great	1
tree	1
the	1
blacks	1
scooped	1
a	1
shallow	1
grave	1
wrapping	1
the	1
tiny	1
body	1
in	1
a	1
blanket	1
jane	1
laid	1
it	1
tenderly	1
in	1
the	1
black	1
hole	1
and	1
turning	1
her	1
head	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
mouldy	1
earth	1
falling	1
upon	1
the	1
pitiful	1
little	1
bundle	1
she	1
breathed	1
a	1
prayer	1
beside	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
the	1
nameless	1
waif	1
that	1
had	1
won	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
innermost	1
recesses	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
then	1
dry	1
eyed	1
but	1
suffering	1
she	1
rose	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
russian	1
through	1
the	1
stygian	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
along	1
the	1
winding	1
leafy	1
corridor	1
that	1
led	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
the	1
black	1
cannibal	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
the	1
white	1
fiend	1
beside	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
impenetrable	1
thickets	1
that	1
fringed	1
the	1
path	1
rising	1
to	1
arch	1
above	1
it	1
and	1
shut	1
out	1
the	1
moon	1
the	1
girl	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
stealthy	1
muffled	1
footfalls	1
of	1
great	1
beasts	1
and	1
ever	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
rose	1
the	1
deafening	1
roars	1
of	1
hunting	1
lions	1
until	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled	1
to	1
the	1
mighty	1
sound	1
the	1
porters	1
lighted	1
torches	1
now	1
and	1
waved	1
them	1
upon	1
either	1
hand	1
to	1
frighten	1
off	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey	1
rokoff	1
urged	1
them	1
to	1
greater	1
speed	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
quavering	1
note	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
jane	1
clayton	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
weak	1
from	1
terror	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
night	1
recalled	1
most	1
vividly	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
jungle	1
with	1
her	1
forest	1
god	1
with	1
the	1
fearless	1
and	1
unconquerable	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
then	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
thoughts	1
of	1
terror	1
though	1
the	1
jungle	1
noises	1
were	1
new	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
a	1
lion	1
had	1
seemed	1
the	1
most	1
awe	1
inspiring	1
sound	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
earth	1
how	1
different	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
now	1
if	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
somewhere	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
seeking	1
her	1
then	1
indeed	1
would	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
succour	1
was	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
it	1
was	1
incredible	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
death	1
for	1
that	1
great	1
body	1
and	1
those	1
mighty	1
thews	1
had	1
rokoff	1
been	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
lord	1
s	1
passing	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
lied	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
she	1
thought	1
why	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
should	1
have	1
deceived	1
her	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
had	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
savage	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
chief	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
tale	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
rude	1
boma	1
that	1
rokoff	1
s	1
porters	1
had	1
thrown	1
up	1
round	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
camp	1
here	1
they	1
found	1
all	1
in	1
turmoil	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
rokoff	1
was	1
very	1
angry	1
and	1
from	1
bits	1
of	1
conversation	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
translate	1
she	1
gleaned	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
further	1
desertions	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
absent	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
deserters	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
his	1
food	1
and	1
ammunition	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
venting	1
his	1
rage	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
where	1
jane	1
stood	1
under	1
guard	1
of	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
sailors	1
he	1
grasped	1
her	1
roughly	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
started	1
to	1
drag	1
her	1
toward	1
his	1
tent	1
the	1
girl	1
struggled	1
and	1
fought	1
to	1
free	1
herself	1
while	1
the	1
two	1
sailors	1
stood	1
by	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
rare	1
treat	1
rokoff	1
did	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
use	1
rough	1
methods	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
difficulty	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
designs	1
repeatedly	1
he	1
struck	1
jane	1
clayton	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
half	1
conscious	1
she	1
was	1
dragged	1
within	1
his	1
tent	1
rokoff	1
s	1
boy	1
had	1
lighted	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
lamp	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
scarce	1
jane	1
had	1
sunk	1
to	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
enclosure	1
slowly	1
her	1
numbed	1
senses	1
were	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
commencing	1
to	1
think	1
very	1
fast	1
indeed	1
quickly	1
her	1
eyes	1
ran	1
round	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
taking	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
its	1
equipment	1
and	1
contents	1
now	1
the	1
russian	1
was	1
lifting	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
attempting	1
to	1
drag	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
cot	1
that	1
stood	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
at	1
his	1
belt	1
hung	1
a	1
heavy	1
revolver	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
themselves	1
upon	1
it	1
her	1
palm	1
itched	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
huge	1
butt	1
she	1
feigned	1
again	1
to	1
swoon	1
but	1
through	1
her	1
half	1
closed	1
lids	1
she	1
waited	1
her	1
opportunity	1
it	1
came	1
just	1
as	1
rokoff	1
was	1
lifting	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
cot	1
a	1
noise	1
at	1
the	1
tent	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
brought	1
his	1
head	1
quickly	1
about	1
and	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
girl	1
the	1
butt	1
of	1
the	1
gun	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
inch	1
from	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
lightning	1
like	1
move	1
she	1
snatched	1
the	1
weapon	1
from	1
its	1
holster	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
rokoff	1
turned	1
back	1
toward	1
her	1
realizing	1
his	1
peril	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
fire	1
for	1
fear	1
the	1
shot	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
people	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
rokoff	1
dead	1
she	1
would	1
fall	1
into	1
hands	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
his	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
fate	1
probably	1
even	1
worse	1
than	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
brutes	1
who	1
stood	1
and	1
laughed	1
as	1
rokoff	1
struck	1
her	1
was	1
still	1
vivid	1
as	1
the	1
rage	1
and	1
fear	1
filled	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
slav	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
jane	1
clayton	1
raised	1
the	1
heavy	1
revolver	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
pasty	1
face	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
strength	1
dealt	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
terrific	1
blow	1
between	1
the	1
eyes	1
without	1
a	1
sound	1
he	1
sank	1
limp	1
and	1
unconscious	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
girl	1
stood	1
beside	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
least	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
his	1
lust	1
outside	1
the	1
tent	1
she	1
again	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
that	1
had	1
distracted	1
rokoff	1
s	1
attention	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
but	1
fearing	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
her	1
deed	1
she	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
table	1
upon	1
which	1
burned	1
the	1
oil	1
lamp	1
and	1
extinguished	1
the	1
smudgy	1
evil	1
smelling	1
flame	1
in	1
the	1
total	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
interior	1
she	1
paused	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
collect	1
her	1
wits	1
and	1
plan	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
step	1
in	1
her	1
venture	1
for	1
freedom	1
about	1
her	1
was	1
a	1
camp	1
of	1
enemies	1
beyond	1
these	1
foes	1
a	1
black	1
wilderness	1
of	1
savage	1
jungle	1
peopled	1
by	1
hideous	1
beasts	1
of	1
prey	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
hideous	1
human	1
beasts	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
chance	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
survive	1
even	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
constant	1
dangers	1
that	1
would	1
confront	1
her	1
there	1
but	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
through	1
so	1
many	1
perils	1
unscathed	1
and	1
that	1
somewhere	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
faraway	1
world	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
was	1
doubtless	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment	1
crying	1
for	1
her	1
filled	1
her	1
with	1
determination	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
effort	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
seemingly	1
impossible	1
and	1
cross	1
that	1
awful	1
land	1
of	1
horror	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
remote	1
chance	1
of	1
succour	1
she	1
might	1
find	1
there	1
rokoff	1
s	1
tent	1
stood	1
almost	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
boma	1
surrounding	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
tents	1
and	1
shelters	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
companions	1
and	1
the	1
natives	1
of	1
his	1
safari	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
these	1
and	1
find	1
egress	1
through	1
the	1
boma	1
seemed	1
a	1
task	1
too	1
fraught	1
with	1
insurmountable	1
obstacles	1
to	1
warrant	1
even	1
the	1
slightest	1
consideration	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
until	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
discovered	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
naught	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
risked	1
to	1
gain	1
her	1
freedom	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
stealthy	1
step	1
and	1
every	1
sense	1
alert	1
she	1
approached	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
her	1
adventure	1
groping	1
along	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
canvas	1
wall	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
opening	1
there	1
quickly	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
unconscious	1
russian	1
in	1
his	1
belt	1
her	1
groping	1
fingers	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
hunting	1
knife	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
she	1
cut	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
silently	1
she	1
stepped	1
without	1
to	1
her	1
immense	1
relief	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
camp	1
was	1
apparently	1
asleep	1
in	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
flickering	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
fires	1
she	1
saw	1
but	1
a	1
single	1
sentry	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
dozing	1
upon	1
his	1
haunches	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
enclosure	1
keeping	1
the	1
tent	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
she	1
crossed	1
between	1
the	1
small	1
shelters	1
of	1
the	1
native	1
porters	1
to	1
the	1
boma	1
wall	1
beyond	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
tangled	1
jungle	1
she	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
lions	1
the	1
laughing	1
of	1
hyenas	1
and	1
the	1
countless	1
nameless	1
noises	1
of	1
the	1
midnight	1
jungle	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
hesitated	1
trembling	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
prowling	1
beasts	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
was	1
appalling	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
brave	1
toss	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
attacked	1
the	1
thorny	1
boma	1
wall	1
with	1
her	1
delicate	1
hands	1
torn	1
and	1
bleeding	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
she	1
worked	1
on	1
breathlessly	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
opening	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
worm	1
her	1
body	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
stood	1
outside	1
the	1
enclosure	1
behind	1
her	1
lay	1
a	1
fate	1
worse	1
than	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
before	1
her	1
lay	1
an	1
almost	1
certain	1
fate	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
death	1
sudden	1
merciful	1
and	1
honourable	1
death	1
without	1
a	1
tremor	1
and	1
without	1
regret	1
she	1
darted	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
mysterious	1
jungle	1
had	1
closed	1
about	1
her	1
chapter	1
14	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
tambudza	1
leading	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
toward	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1

moved	1
very	1
slowly	1
along	1

path	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
her	1
legs	1
stiff	1
with	1
rheumatism	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
runners	1
dispatched	1
by	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
to	1
warn	1
rokoff	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
giant	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
slain	1
that	1
night	1
reached	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
camp	1
before	1
tarzan	1
and	1
his	1
ancient	1
guide	1
had	1
covered	1
half	1
the	1
distance	1
the	1
guides	1
found	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
camp	1
in	1
a	1
turmoil	1
rokoff	1
had	1
that	1
morning	1
been	1
discovered	1
stunned	1
and	1
bleeding	1
within	1
his	1
tent	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
recovered	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
realized	1
that	1
jane	1
clayton	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
rage	1
was	1
boundless	1
rushing	1
about	1
the	1
camp	1
with	1
his	1
rifle	1
he	1
had	1
sought	1
to	1
shoot	1
down	1
the	1
native	1
sentries	1
who	1
had	1
allowed	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
to	1
elude	1
their	1
vigilance	1
but	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
whites	1
realizing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
a	1
precarious	1
position	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
numerous	1
desertions	1
that	1
rokoff	1
s	1
cruelty	1
had	1
brought	1
about	1
seized	1
and	1
disarmed	1
him	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
messengers	1
from	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
but	1
scarce	1
had	1
they	1
told	1
their	1
story	1
and	1
rokoff	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
depart	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
village	1
when	1
other	1
runners	1
panting	1
from	1
the	1
exertions	1
of	1
their	1
swift	1
flight	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
rushed	1
breathless	1
into	1
the	1
firelight	1
crying	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
white	1
giant	1
had	1
escaped	1
from	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
wreak	1
vengeance	1
against	1
his	1
enemies	1
instantly	1
confusion	1
reigned	1
within	1
the	1
encircling	1
boma	1
the	1
blacks	1
belonging	1
to	1
rokoff	1
s	1
safari	1
were	1
terror	1
stricken	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
giant	1
who	1
hunted	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
a	1
fierce	1
pack	1
of	1
apes	1
and	1
panthers	1
at	1
his	1
heels	1
before	1
the	1
whites	1
realized	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
the	1
superstitious	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
natives	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
scurrying	1
into	1
the	1
bush	1
their	1
own	1
carriers	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
messengers	1
from	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
haste	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
neglected	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
every	1
article	1
of	1
value	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
thus	1
rokoff	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
white	1
sailors	1
found	1
themselves	1
deserted	1
and	1
robbed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
wilderness	1
the	1
russian	1
following	1
his	1
usual	1
custom	1
berated	1
his	1
companions	1
laying	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
for	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
hopeless	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
now	1
found	1
themselves	1
but	1
the	1
sailors	1
were	1
in	1
no	1
mood	1
to	1
brook	1
his	1
insults	1
and	1
his	1
cursing	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
tirade	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
drew	1
a	1
revolver	1
and	1
fired	1
point	1
blank	1
at	1
the	1
russian	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
aim	1
was	1
poor	1
but	1
his	1
act	1
so	1
terrified	1
rokoff	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
for	1
his	1
tent	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
chanced	1
to	1
pass	1
beyond	1
the	1
boma	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
sent	1
his	1
craven	1
heart	1
cold	1
with	1
a	1
fear	1
that	1
almost	1
expunged	1
his	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
men	1
at	1
his	1
back	1
who	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
were	1
all	1
firing	1
in	1
hate	1
and	1
revenge	1
at	1
his	1
retreating	1
figure	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
the	1
giant	1
figure	1
of	1
an	1
almost	1
naked	1
white	1
man	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
bush	1
darting	1
into	1
his	1
tent	1
the	1
russian	1
did	1
not	1
halt	1
in	1
his	1
flight	1
but	1
kept	1
right	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
rear	1
wall	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
slit	1
that	1
jane	1
clayton	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
muscovite	1
scurried	1
like	1
a	1
hunted	1
rabbit	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
that	1
still	1
gaped	1
in	1
the	1
boma	1
s	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
his	1
own	1
prey	1
had	1
escaped	1
and	1
as	1
tarzan	1
approached	1
the	1
camp	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
rokoff	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
the	1
wake	1
of	1
jane	1
clayton	1
as	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
entered	1
the	1
boma	1
with	1
old	1
tambudza	1
at	1
his	1
elbow	1
the	1
seven	1
sailors	1
recognizing	1
him	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction	1
tarzan	1
saw	1
that	1
rokoff	1
was	1
not	1
among	1
them	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
their	1
way	1
his	1
business	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
russian	1
whom	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
tent	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
sailors	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
jungle	1
would	1
exact	1
from	1
them	1
expiation	1
for	1
their	1
villainies	1
nor	1
doubtless	1
was	1
he	1
wrong	1
for	1
his	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
white	1
man	1
s	1
eyes	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
finding	1
rokoff	1
s	1
tent	1
empty	1
tarzan	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
when	1
tambudza	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
resulted	1
from	1
word	1
reaching	1
him	1
from	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
that	1
tarzan	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
village	1
he	1
has	1
doubtless	1
hastened	1
there	1
argued	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
find	1
him	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
at	1
once	1
tarzan	1
himself	1
thought	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
probably	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fact	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
waste	1
time	1
in	1
an	1
endeavour	1
to	1
locate	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
trail	1
but	1
instead	1
set	1
out	1
briskly	1
for	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
leaving	1
tambudza	1
to	1
plod	1
slowly	1
in	1
his	1
wake	1
his	1
one	1
hope	1
was	1
that	1
jane	1
was	1
still	1
safe	1
and	1
with	1
rokoff	1
if	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
before	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
wrest	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
russian	1
he	1
knew	1
now	1
that	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
was	1
treacherous	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
fight	1
to	1
regain	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
wished	1
that	1
mugambi	1
sheeta	1
akut	1
and	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
single	1
handed	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
child	1
s	1
play	1
to	1
bring	1
jane	1
safely	1
from	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
two	1
such	1
scoundrels	1
as	1
rokoff	1
and	1
the	1
wily	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
either	1
rokoff	1
or	1
jane	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
trust	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
he	1
wasted	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
futile	1
inquiry	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
unexpected	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
return	1
and	1
so	1
quickly	1
had	1
he	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
after	1
learning	1
that	1
those	1
he	1
sought	1
were	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
waganwazam	1
that	1
old	1
m	1
ganwazam	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
going	1
swinging	1
through	1
the	1
trees	1
he	1
hastened	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
deserted	1
camp	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
recently	1
left	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
the	1
logical	1
place	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
rokoff	1
and	1
jane	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
boma	1
he	1
circled	1
carefully	1
about	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
enclosure	1
until	1
opposite	1
a	1
break	1
in	1
the	1
thorny	1
wall	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
indications	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
recently	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
his	1
acute	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
both	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
sought	1
had	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
trail	1
and	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
faint	1
spoor	1
far	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
terror	1
stricken	1
young	1
woman	1
was	1
slinking	1
along	1
a	1
narrow	1
game	1
trail	1
fearful	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
would	1
bring	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
some	1
savage	1
beast	1
or	1
equally	1
savage	1
man	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
on	1
hoping	1
against	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
direction	1
that	1
would	1
lead	1
her	1
eventually	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
she	1
came	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
a	1
familiar	1
spot	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
trail	1
beneath	1
a	1
giant	1
tree	1
lay	1
a	1
little	1
heap	1
of	1
loosely	1
piled	1
brush	1
to	1
her	1
dying	1
day	1
that	1
little	1
spot	1
of	1
jungle	1
would	1
be	1
indelibly	1
impressed	1
upon	1
her	1
memory	1
it	1
was	1
where	1
anderssen	1
had	1
hidden	1
her	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
vain	1
effort	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
from	1
rokoff	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
recalled	1
the	1
rifle	1
and	1
ammunition	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
thrust	1
upon	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
until	1
now	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
them	1
entirely	1
still	1
clutched	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
was	1
the	1
revolver	1
she	1
had	1
snatched	1
from	1
rokoff	1
s	1
belt	1
but	1
that	1
could	1
contain	1
at	1
most	1
not	1
over	1
six	1
cartridges	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
furnish	1
her	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
protection	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
long	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
bated	1
breath	1
she	1
groped	1
beneath	1
the	1
little	1
mound	1
scarce	1
daring	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
treasure	1
remained	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
infinite	1
relief	1
and	1
joy	1
her	1
hand	1
came	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
the	1
barrel	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
weapon	1
and	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
bandoleer	1
of	1
cartridges	1
as	1
she	1
threw	1
the	1
latter	1
about	1
her	1
shoulder	1
and	1
felt	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
game	1
gun	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
a	1
sudden	1
sense	1
of	1
security	1
suffused	1
her	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
new	1
hope	1
and	1
a	1
feeling	1
almost	1
of	1
assured	1
success	1
that	1
she	1
again	1
set	1
forward	1
upon	1
her	1
journey	1
that	1
night	1
she	1
slept	1
in	1
the	1
crotch	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
as	1
tarzan	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
doing	1
and	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
was	1
upon	1
her	1
way	1
again	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
cross	1
a	1
little	1
clearing	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
huge	1
ape	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
blowing	1
directly	1
across	1
the	1
clearing	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
jane	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
putting	1
herself	1
downwind	1
from	1
the	1
huge	1
creature	1
then	1
she	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
heavy	1
bush	1
and	1
watched	1
holding	1
the	1
rifle	1
ready	1
for	1
instant	1
use	1
to	1
her	1
consternation	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
apes	1
were	1
pausing	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
clearing	1
they	1
came	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
where	1
they	1
stood	1
looking	1
backward	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
others	1
of	1
their	1
tribe	1
jane	1
wished	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
some	1
little	1
eddying	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
might	1
carry	1
her	1
scent	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
nostrils	1
and	1
then	1
what	1
would	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
her	1
rifle	1
amount	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
those	1
gigantic	1
muscles	1
and	1
mighty	1
fangs	1
her	1
eyes	1
moved	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
between	1
the	1
apes	1
and	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
toward	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
gazing	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
perceived	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
their	1
halt	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
awaited	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
stalked	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
positive	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
lithe	1
sinewy	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
panther	1
glide	1
noiselessly	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
emerged	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
quickly	1
the	1
beast	1
trotted	1
across	1
the	1
clearing	1
toward	1
the	1
anthropoids	1
jane	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
apparent	1
apathy	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
her	1
wonder	1
turned	1
to	1
amazement	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
great	1
cat	1
come	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
apes	1
who	1
appeared	1
entirely	1
unconcerned	1
by	1
its	1
presence	1
and	1
squatting	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
midst	1
fell	1
assiduously	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
preening	1
which	1
occupies	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
waking	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
cat	1
family	1
if	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
was	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
natural	1
enemies	1
fraternizing	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
emotions	1
little	1
short	1
of	1
fear	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sanity	1
that	1
she	1
presently	1
saw	1
a	1
tall	1
muscular	1
warrior	1
enter	1
the	1
clearing	1
and	1
join	1
the	1
group	1
of	1
savage	1
beasts	1
assembled	1
there	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
positive	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
torn	1
to	1
pieces	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
half	1
risen	1
from	1
her	1
shelter	1
raising	1
her	1
rifle	1
to	1
her	1
shoulder	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
to	1
avert	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
terrible	1
fate	1
now	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
actually	1
conversing	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
issuing	1
orders	1
to	1
them	1
presently	1
the	1
entire	1
company	1
filed	1
on	1
across	1
the	1
clearing	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
gasp	1
of	1
mingled	1
incredulity	1
and	1
relief	1
jane	1
clayton	1
staggered	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
fled	1
on	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
terrible	1
horde	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
passed	1
her	1
while	1
a	1
half	1
mile	1
behind	1
her	1
another	1
individual	1
following	1
the	1
same	1
trail	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
frozen	1
with	1
terror	1
behind	1
an	1
ant	1
hill	1
as	1
the	1
hideous	1
band	1
passed	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
one	1
was	1
rokoff	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
recognized	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
awful	1
aggregation	1
as	1
allies	1
of	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
no	1
sooner	1
therefore	1
had	1
the	1
beasts	1
passed	1
him	1
than	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
raced	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
put	1
as	1
much	1
distance	1
as	1
possible	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
these	1
frightful	1
beasts	1
so	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
as	1
jane	1
clayton	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
down	1
which	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
float	1
to	1
the	1
ocean	1
and	1
eventual	1
rescue	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
in	1
her	1
rear	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
the	1
girl	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
dugout	1
drawn	1
half	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
tied	1
securely	1
to	1
a	1
near	1
by	1
tree	1
this	1
she	1
felt	1
would	1
solve	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
transportation	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
could	1
she	1
but	1
launch	1
the	1
huge	1
unwieldy	1
craft	1
unfastening	1
the	1
rope	1
that	1
had	1
moored	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
jane	1
pushed	1
frantically	1
upon	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
canoe	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
results	1
that	1
were	1
apparent	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
attempting	1
to	1
shove	1
the	1
earth	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
orbit	1
she	1
was	1
about	1
winded	1
when	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
working	1
the	1
dugout	1
into	1
the	1
stream	1
by	1
loading	1
the	1
stern	1
with	1
ballast	1
and	1
then	1
rocking	1
the	1
bow	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
along	1
the	1
bank	1
until	1
the	1
craft	1
eventually	1
worked	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
stones	1
or	1
rocks	1
available	1
but	1
along	1
the	1
shore	1
she	1
found	1
quantities	1
of	1
driftwood	1
deposited	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
at	1
a	1
slightly	1
higher	1
stage	1
these	1
she	1
gathered	1
and	1
piled	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
her	1
immense	1
relief	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
bow	1
rise	1
gently	1
from	1
the	1
mud	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
drift	1
slowly	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
until	1
it	1
again	1
lodged	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
farther	1
down	1
stream	1
jane	1
found	1
that	1
by	1
running	1
back	1
and	1
forth	1
between	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
stern	1
she	1
could	1
alternately	1
raise	1
and	1
lower	1
each	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
she	1
shifted	1
her	1
weight	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
that	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
leaped	1
to	1
the	1
stern	1
the	1
canoe	1
moved	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
farther	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
as	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
her	1
plan	1
approached	1
more	1
closely	1
to	1
fruition	1
she	1
became	1
so	1
wrapped	1
in	1
her	1
efforts	1
that	1
she	1
failed	1
to	1
note	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
standing	1
beneath	1
a	1
huge	1
tree	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
emerged	1
he	1
watched	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
labours	1
with	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
malicious	1
grin	1
upon	1
his	1
swarthy	1
countenance	1
the	1
boat	1
at	1
last	1
became	1
so	1
nearly	1
free	1
of	1
the	1
retarding	1
mud	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
that	1
jane	1
felt	1
positive	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
pole	1
it	1
off	1
into	1
deeper	1
water	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
paddles	1
which	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
rude	1
craft	1
with	1
this	1
end	1
in	1
view	1
she	1
seized	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
implements	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
plunged	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
bottom	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
when	1
her	1
eyes	1
happened	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
as	1
her	1
gaze	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
terror	1
rose	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
it	1
was	1
rokoff	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
toward	1
her	1
now	1
and	1
shouting	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
wait	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
shoot	1
though	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
entirely	1
unarmed	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
discover	1
just	1
how	1
he	1
intended	1
making	1
good	1
his	1
threat	1
jane	1
clayton	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
misfortunes	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
the	1
russian	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
escaped	1
from	1
his	1
tent	1
so	1
she	1
believed	1
that	1
his	1
followers	1
must	1
be	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
however	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
falling	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
clutches	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
die	1
at	1
once	1
than	1
that	1
that	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
her	1
another	1
minute	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
would	1
be	1
free	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
beyond	1
rokoff	1
s	1
power	1
to	1
stop	1
her	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
boat	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
the	1
cowardly	1
rokoff	1
would	1
dare	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
swim	1
the	1
crocodile	1
infested	1
water	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
overtake	1
her	1
rokoff	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
bent	1
more	1
upon	1
escape	1
than	1
aught	1
else	1
he	1
would	1
gladly	1
have	1
forgone	1
any	1
designs	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
upon	1
jane	1
clayton	1
would	1
she	1
but	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
share	1
this	1
means	1
of	1
escape	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
discovered	1
he	1
would	1
promise	1
anything	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
aboard	1
the	1
dugout	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
easily	1
reach	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
before	1
it	1
cleared	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
promises	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
not	1
that	1
rokoff	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
the	1
slightest	1
compunction	1
in	1
ignoring	1
any	1
promises	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
girl	1
but	1
he	1
disliked	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
sue	1
for	1
favour	1
with	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
recently	1
assaulted	1
and	1
escaped	1
him	1
already	1
he	1
was	1
gloating	1
over	1
the	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
of	1
revenge	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
while	1
the	1
heavy	1
dugout	1
drifted	1
its	1
slow	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
ocean	1
jane	1
clayton	1
working	1
furiously	1
to	1
shove	1
the	1
boat	1
beyond	1
his	1
reach	1
suddenly	1
realized	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
successful	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
lurch	1
the	1
dugout	1
swung	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
current	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
russian	1
reached	1
out	1
to	1
place	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
its	1
bow	1
his	1
fingers	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
their	1
goal	1
by	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
inches	1
the	1
girl	1
almost	1
collapsed	1
with	1
the	1
reaction	1
from	1
the	1
terrific	1
mental	1
physical	1
and	1
nervous	1
strain	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
labouring	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
few	1
minutes	1
but	1
thank	1
heaven	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
was	1
safe	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
breathed	1
a	1
silent	1
prayer	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
sudden	1
expression	1
of	1
triumph	1
lighten	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
cursing	1
russian	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
he	1
dropped	1
suddenly	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
grasping	1
firmly	1
upon	1
something	1
which	1
wriggled	1
through	1
the	1
mud	1
toward	1
the	1
water	1
jane	1
clayton	1
crouched	1
wide	1
eyed	1
and	1
horror	1
stricken	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
as	1
she	1
realized	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
instant	1
success	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
to	1
failure	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
indeed	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
malignant	1
rokoff	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
grasped	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
trailing	1
rope	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
dugout	1
had	1
been	1
moored	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
chapter	1
15	1
down	1
the	1
ugambi	1
halfway	1
between	1
the	1
ugambi	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
the	1
waganwazam	1
tarzan	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
pack	1
moving	1
slowly	1
along	1
his	1
old	1
spoor	1
mugambi	1
could	1
scarce	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
the	1
mate	1
of	1
his	1
savage	1
master	1
had	1
passed	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
it	1
seemed	1
incredible	1
that	1
two	1
human	1
beings	1
should	1
have	1
come	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
them	1
without	1
having	1
been	1
detected	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
marvellously	1
keen	1
and	1
alert	1
beasts	1
but	1
tarzan	1
pointed	1
out	1
the	1
spoor	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
he	1
trailed	1
and	1
at	1
certain	1
points	1
the	1
black	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
hiding	1
as	1
the	1
pack	1
passed	1
them	1
watching	1
every	1
move	1
of	1
the	1
ferocious	1
creatures	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
apparent	1
to	1
tarzan	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
jane	1
and	1
rokoff	1
were	1
not	1
travelling	1
together	1
the	1
spoor	1
showed	1
distinctly	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
at	1
first	1
though	1
the	1
farther	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
continued	1
along	1
the	1
trail	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
it	1
became	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
rapidly	1
overhauling	1
his	1
quarry	1
at	1
first	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
spoor	1
of	1
wild	1
beasts	1
over	1
the	1
footprints	1
of	1
jane	1
clayton	1
while	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
all	1
rokoff	1
s	1
spoor	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
trail	1
after	1
the	1
animals	1
had	1
left	1
their	1
records	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
but	1
later	1
there	1
were	1
fewer	1
and	1
fewer	1
animal	1
imprints	1
occurring	1
between	1
those	1
of	1
jane	1
s	1
and	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
feet	1
until	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
river	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
rokoff	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
yards	1
behind	1
the	1
girl	1
he	1
felt	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
close	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
now	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
thrill	1
of	1
expectation	1
he	1
leaped	1
rapidly	1
forward	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
swinging	1
swiftly	1
through	1
the	1
trees	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
bank	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
rokoff	1
had	1
overhauled	1
jane	1
as	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
launch	1
the	1
cumbersome	1
dugout	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
along	1
the	1

at	1

any	1

it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1

off	1
a	1

embarked	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1

in	1

just	1
as	1
it	1
rounded	1
a	1
bend	1
that	1
shut	1
it	1
off	1
from	1

a	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
just	1
as	1
the	1

came	1
in	1

of	1

down	1

just	1
where	1
the	1
river	1
curved	1
inward	1
from	1
their	1
sight	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

a	1
half	1

of	1
rapid	1
travelling	1
across	1
the	1

over	1

by	1
a	1
short	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1

him	1
upon	1

in	1
the	1

feared	1
above	1
all	1
other	1

upon	1
the	1

though	1
the	1

that	1
he	1
was	1
safe	1
from	1
his	1
enemy	1
the	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
threw	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
frenzy	1
of	1
trembling	1
cowardice	1
which	1
became	1
frantic	1
hysteria	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1

dive	1
fearlessly	1
into	1
the	1

waters	1
of	1
the	1

out	1
into	1

with	1

still	1
glued	1
upon	1
the	1

that	1
pursued	1

struck	1
out	1
madly	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
augment	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
unwieldy	1

and	1
from	1
the	1

a	1
sinister	1
ripple	1
unseen	1
by	1

moved	1
steadily	1
toward	1
the	1

frozen	1
with	1

his	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

then	1
a	1
sudden	1
commotion	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
behind	1
the	1
swimmer	1
caught	1
his	1
attention	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
caused	1
it	1
at	1
the	1

instant	1
tarzan	1
felt	1
mighty	1
jaws	1
close	1
upon	1
his	1

to	1

free	1
and	1
raise	1
himself	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
his	1
efforts	1

have	1
succeeded	1
had	1
not	1
this	1
unexpected	1
interruption	1
galvanized	1
the	1
malign	1
brain	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
into	1
instant	1
action	1
with	1
its	1
sudden	1
promise	1
of	1
deliverance	1
and	1
revenge	1
like	1
a	1
venomous	1
snake	1
the	1
man	1
leaped	1
toward	1
the	1
stern	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
swift	1
blow	1
struck	1
tarzan	1
across	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
paddle	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
fingers	1
slipped	1
from	1
their	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
gunwale	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
struggle	1
at	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
swirl	1
of	1
waters	1
a	1
little	1
eddy	1
and	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
bubbles	1
soon	1
smoothed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
flowing	1
current	1
marked	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men	1
beneath	1
the	1
gloomy	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
forbidding	1
ugambi	1
weak	1
from	1
terror	1
rokoff	1
sank	1
shuddering	1
into	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
dugout	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
realize	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
was	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
silent	1
struggling	1
white	1
man	1
disappearing	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
unthinkable	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
slimy	1
mud	1
of	1
the	1
bottom	1
slowly	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
meant	1
to	1
him	1
filtered	1
into	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
cruel	1
smile	1
of	1
relief	1
and	1
triumph	1
touched	1
his	1
lips	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
short	1
lived	1
for	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
congratulating	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
comparatively	1
safe	1
to	1
proceed	1
upon	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
unmolested	1
a	1
mighty	1
pandemonium	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
bank	1
close	1
by	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
sought	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
sound	1
he	1
saw	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1
glaring	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
hate	1
filled	1
eyes	1
a	1
devil	1
faced	1
panther	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
hideous	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
giant	1
black	1
warrior	1
who	1
shook	1
his	1
fist	1
at	1
him	1
threatening	1
him	1
with	1
terrible	1
death	1
the	1
nightmare	1
of	1
that	1
flight	1
down	1
the	1
ugambi	1
with	1
the	1
hideous	1
horde	1
racing	1
after	1
him	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
now	1
abreast	1
of	1
him	1
now	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
far	1
behind	1
for	1
hours	1
and	1
once	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day	1
only	1
to	1
reappear	1
again	1
upon	1
his	1
trail	1
grim	1
relentless	1
and	1
terrible	1
reduced	1
the	1
russian	1
from	1
a	1
strong	1
and	1
robust	1
man	1
to	1
an	1
emaciated	1
white	1
haired	1
fear	1
gibbering	1
thing	1
before	1
ever	1
the	1
bay	1
and	1
the	1
ocean	1
broke	1
upon	1
his	1
hopeless	1
vision	1
past	1
populous	1
villages	1
he	1
had	1
fled	1
time	1
and	1
again	1
warriors	1
had	1
put	1
out	1
in	1
their	1
canoes	1
to	1
intercept	1
him	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
the	1
hideous	1
horde	1
had	1
swept	1
into	1
view	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
terrified	1
natives	1
shrieking	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
to	1
lose	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
nowhere	1
in	1
his	1
flight	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
aught	1
of	1
jane	1
clayton	1
not	1
once	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
her	1
since	1
that	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
brim	1
his	1
hand	1
had	1
closed	1
upon	1
the	1
rope	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
her	1
dugout	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
believed	1
her	1
safely	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
again	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
an	1
instant	1
later	1
as	1
the	1
girl	1
snatched	1
up	1
a	1
heavy	1
express	1
rifle	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
craft	1
and	1
levelled	1
it	1
full	1
at	1
his	1
breast	1
quickly	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
the	1
rope	1
then	1
and	1
seen	1
her	1
float	1
away	1
beyond	1
his	1
reach	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
racing	1
up	1
stream	1
toward	1
a	1
little	1
tributary	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
hidden	1
the	1
canoe	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
had	1
come	1
thus	1
far	1
upon	1
their	1
journey	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
girl	1
and	1
anderssen	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
her	1
there	1
seemed	1
little	1
doubt	1
in	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
mind	1
however	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
by	1
warriors	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
villages	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
well	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
rid	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
human	1
enemies	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
gladly	1
have	1
had	1
them	1
all	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
could	1
he	1
thus	1
have	1
been	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
menace	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
creatures	1
who	1
pursued	1
him	1
with	1
awful	1
relentlessness	1
screaming	1
and	1
growling	1
at	1
him	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
came	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
terror	1
was	1
the	1
panther	1
the	1
flaming	1
eyed	1
devil	1
faced	1
panther	1
whose	1
grinning	1
jaws	1
gaped	1
wide	1
at	1
him	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
whose	1
fiery	1
orbs	1
gleamed	1
wickedly	1
out	1
across	1
the	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
cimmerian	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
nights	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1

with	1
renewed	1
hope	1
for	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
yellow	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
bay	1
floated	1
the	1
kincaid	1
at	1
anchor	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
little	1
steamer	1
away	1
to	1
coal	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
leaving	1
paulvitch	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
cried	1
aloud	1
in	1
his	1
relief	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
returned	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
frantically	1
he	1
alternately	1
paddled	1
furiously	1
toward	1
her	1
and	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
waving	1
his	1
paddle	1
and	1
crying	1
aloud	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
attract	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
board	1
but	1
loud	1
as	1
he	1
screamed	1
his	1
cries	1
awakened	1
no	1
answering	1
challenge	1
from	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
silent	1
craft	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
hurried	1
backward	1
glance	1
revealed	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
snarling	1
pack	1
even	1
now	1
he	1
thought	1
these	1
manlike	1
devils	1
might	1
yet	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
reach	1
him	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
steamer	1
unless	1
there	1
were	1
those	1
there	1
to	1
repel	1
them	1
with	1
firearms	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
upon	1
the	1
kincaid	1
where	1
was	1
paulvitch	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
deserted	1
and	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
doomed	1
to	1
be	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
terrible	1
fate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
flying	1
from	1
through	1
all	1
these	1
hideous	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
he	1
shivered	1
as	1
might	1
one	1
upon	1
whose	1
brow	1
death	1
has	1
already	1
laid	1
his	1
clammy	1
finger	1
yet	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
paddle	1
frantically	1
toward	1
the	1
steamer	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
after	1
what	1
seemed	1
an	1
eternity	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
dugout	1
bumped	1
against	1
the	1
timbers	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
over	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
hung	1
a	1
monkey	1
ladder	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
russian	1
grasped	1
it	1
to	1
ascend	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
warning	1
challenge	1
from	1
above	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
cold	1
relentless	1
muzzle	1
of	1
a	1
rifle	1
after	1
jane	1
clayton	1
with	1
rifle	1
levelled	1
at	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
rokoff	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
holding	1
him	1
off	1
until	1
the	1
dugout	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
refuge	1
had	1
drifted	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
beyond	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
reach	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
paddling	1
to	1
the	1
swiftest	1
sweep	1
of	1
the	1
channel	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
for	1
long	1
days	1
and	1
weary	1
nights	1
cease	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1

when	1
during	1
the	1
hottest	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
drift	1
as	1
the	1
current	1
would	1
take	1
her	1
lying	1
prone	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
her	1
face	1
sheltered	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
palm	1

thus	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
gain	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
voyage	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
she	1
continually	1
sought	1
to	1
augment	1
the	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1

by	1
wielding	1
the	1
heavy	1
paddle	1
rokoff	1
on	1

had	1
used	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
intelligence	1
in	1
his	1
flight	1
along	1
the	1
ugambi	1
so	1
that	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
not	1
his	1
craft	1
had	1
drifted	1
in	1
the	1
slow	1
going	1
eddies	1
for	1
he	1
habitually	1
hugged	1
the	1
bank	1
farthest	1
from	1
that	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
hideous	1
horde	1
pursued	1
and	1
menaced	1
him	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
subsequent	1
to	1
the	1
girl	1
yet	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
bay	1
fully	1
two	1
hours	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
the	1
anchored	1
ship	1
upon	1
the	1
quiet	1
water	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
heart	1
had	1
beat	1
fast	1
with	1
hope	1
and	1
thanksgiving	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
drew	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
craft	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
kincaid	1
her	1
pleasure	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
gravest	1
misgivings	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
however	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
current	1
that	1
carried	1
her	1
toward	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
much	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
her	1
muscles	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
forced	1
the	1
heavy	1
dugout	1
up	1
stream	1
against	1
it	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
her	1
was	1
to	1
attempt	1
either	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
shore	1
without	1
being	1
seen	1
by	1
those	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
or	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
upon	1
their	1
mercy	1
otherwise	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
swept	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
shore	1
held	1
little	1
hope	1
of	1
life	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
location	1
of	1
the	1
friendly	1
mosula	1
village	1
to	1
which	1
anderssen	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
their	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
kincaid	1
with	1
rokoff	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
steamer	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
by	1
offering	1
those	1
in	1
charge	1
a	1
large	1
reward	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
carry	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
civilized	1
port	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
risking	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
the	1
steamer	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
current	1
was	1
bearing	1
her	1
swiftly	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
exertion	1
could	1
she	1
direct	1
the	1
awkward	1
craft	1
toward	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
decision	1
to	1
board	1
the	1
steamer	1
she	1
now	1
looked	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
aid	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
the	1
decks	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
empty	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
life	1
aboard	1
the	1
ship	1
the	1
dugout	1
was	1
drawing	1
closer	1
and	1
closer	1
to	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
and	1
yet	1
no	1
hail	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
from	1
any	1
lookout	1
aboard	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
more	1
jane	1
realized	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
swept	1
beyond	1
the	1
steamer	1
and	1
then	1
unless	1
they	1
lowered	1
a	1
boat	1
to	1
rescue	1
her	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
carried	1
far	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
by	1
the	1
current	1
and	1
the	1
swift	1
ebb	1
tide	1
that	1
was	1
running	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
called	1
loudly	1
for	1
assistance	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reply	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
shrill	1
scream	1
of	1
some	1
savage	1
beast	1
upon	1
the	1
jungle	1
shrouded	1
shore	1
frantically	1
jane	1
wielded	1
the	1
paddle	1
in	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
carry	1
her	1
craft	1
close	1
alongside	1
the	1
steamer	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
miss	1
her	1
goal	1
by	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
the	1
canoe	1
swung	1
close	1
beneath	1
the	1
steamer	1
s	1
bow	1
and	1
jane	1
barely	1
managed	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
anchor	1
chain	1
heroically	1
she	1
clung	1
to	1
the	1
heavy	1
iron	1
links	1
almost	1
dragged	1
from	1
the	1
canoe	1
by	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
upon	1
her	1
craft	1
beyond	1
her	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
monkey	1
ladder	1
dangling	1
over	1
the	1
steamer	1
s	1
side	1
to	1
release	1
her	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
chance	1
clambering	1
to	1
the	1
ladder	1
as	1
her	1
canoe	1
was	1
swept	1
beneath	1
it	1
seemed	1
beyond	1
the	1
pale	1
of	1
possibility	1
yet	1
to	1
remain	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
anchor	1
chain	1
appeared	1
equally	1
as	1
futile	1
finally	1
her	1
glance	1
chanced	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
rope	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
dugout	1
and	1
making	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
fast	1
to	1
the	1
chain	1
she	1
succeeded	1
in	1
drifting	1
the	1
canoe	1
slowly	1
down	1
until	1
it	1
lay	1
directly	1
beneath	1
the	1
ladder	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
her	1
rifle	1
slung	1
about	1
her	1
shoulders	1
she	1
had	1
clambered	1
safely	1
to	1
the	1
deserted	1
deck	1
her	1
first	1
task	1
was	1
to	1
explore	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
this	1
she	1
did	1
her	1
rifle	1
ready	1
for	1
instant	1
use	1
should	1
she	1
meet	1
with	1
any	1
human	1
menace	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
discovering	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
apparently	1
deserted	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
steamer	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
sailors	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
ship	1
deep	1
in	1
drunken	1
slumber	1
with	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
disgust	1
she	1
clambered	1
above	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
her	1
ability	1
closed	1
and	1
made	1
fast	1
the	1
hatch	1
above	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
guard	1
next	1
she	1
sought	1
the	1
galley	1
and	1
food	1
and	1
having	1
appeased	1
her	1
hunger	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
on	1
deck	1
determined	1
that	1
none	1
should	1
board	1
the	1
kincaid	1
without	1
first	1
having	1
agreed	1
to	1
her	1
demands	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so	1
nothing	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
alarm	1
but	1
then	1
about	1
a	1
bend	1
up	1
stream	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
canoe	1
appear	1
in	1
which	1
sat	1
a	1
single	1
figure	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
proceeded	1
far	1
in	1
her	1
direction	1
before	1
she	1
recognized	1
the	1
occupant	1
as	1
rokoff	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
fellow	1
attempted	1
to	1
board	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
rifle	1
staring	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
when	1
the	1
russian	1
discovered	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
repelled	1
his	1
advance	1
he	1
became	1
furious	1
cursing	1
and	1
threatening	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
horrible	1
manner	1
but	1
finding	1
that	1
these	1
tactics	1
failed	1
to	1
frighten	1
or	1
move	1
the	1
girl	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
fell	1
to	1
pleading	1
and	1
promising	1
jane	1
had	1
but	1
a	1
single	1
reply	1
for	1
his	1
every	1
proposition	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
ever	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
permit	1
rokoff	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
vessel	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
put	1
her	1
threats	1
into	1
action	1
and	1
shoot	1
him	1
should	1
he	1
persist	1
in	1
his	1
endeavour	1
to	1
board	1
the	1
ship	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
so	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
alternative	1
the	1
great	1
coward	1
dropped	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
dugout	1
and	1
at	1
imminent	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
swept	1
to	1
sea	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
making	1
the	1
shore	1
far	1
down	1
the	1
bay	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
from	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
horde	1
of	1
beasts	1
stood	1
snarling	1
and	1
roaring	1
jane	1
clayton	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
could	1
not	1
alone	1
and	1
unaided	1
bring	1
his	1
heavy	1
craft	1
back	1
up	1
stream	1
to	1
the	1
kincaid	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
further	1
fear	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
hideous	1
crew	1
upon	1
the	1
shore	1

thought	1
she	1
recognized	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
far	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
several	1
days	1
before	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
beyond	1

that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
one	1

them	1
down	1

to	1

the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
tarzan	1
of	1

realized	1
that	1

was	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
great	1
jaws	1
of	1
a	1
crocodile	1

did	1

might	1
have	1
done	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
hope	1
and	1
resign	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
fate	1
instead	1
he	1
filled	1
his	1
lungs	1
with	1
air	1
before	1
the	1
huge	1
reptile	1
dragged	1
him	1
beneath	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
muscles	1
fought	1
bitterly	1
for	1
freedom	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
element	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
was	1
too	1
greatly	1
handicapped	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
excite	1
the	1
monster	1
to	1
greater	1
speed	1
as	1
it	1
dragged	1
its	1
prey	1
swiftly	1
through	1
the	1

were	1
bursting	1
for	1

in	1
the	1
last	1
paroxysm	1
of	1
his	1
suffering	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
avenge	1
his	1
own	1
death	1
his	1
body	1
trailed	1
out	1
beside	1
the	1

carcass	1
of	1
his	1
captor	1
and	1
into	1
the	1

armour	1

served	1
to	1
accelerate	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
crocodile	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
limit	1
of	1
his	1
endurance	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
body	1

his	1

was	1
the	1

for	1

upon	1
the	1

to	1
which	1
the	1
animal	1
had	1
borne	1
him	1
close	1
at	1

side	1

could	1
feel	1
the	1
cold	1
hard	1
plates	1
of	1
the	1

rising	1

tarzan	1
to	1
his	1
knees	1
beside	1

to	1
his	1

amazement	1
he	1
found	1
that	1

to	1

feet	1
the	1
ape	1

groped	1
about	1
the	1
reeking	1
oozy	1
den	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
a	1
subterranean	1
chamber	1
amply	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
have	1

animals	1

as	1
the	1

only	1
means	1
of	1
ingress	1
or	1
egress	1
lay	1
through	1
the	1
submerged	1
opening	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
crocodile	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
his	1
first	1
thought	1
of	1
course	1
was	1
of	1
escape	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
beyond	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
seemed	1
highly	1
improbable	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
turns	1
and	1
windings	1
in	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
or	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
he	1
might	1
meet	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
slimy	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
upon	1
his	1
journey	1
outward	1
even	1
should	1
he	1
reach	1
the	1
river	1
in	1
safety	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
again	1
attacked	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
effect	1
a	1
safe	1
landing	1
still	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
alternative	1
and	1
filling	1
his	1
lungs	1
with	1
the	1
close	1
and	1
reeking	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
dived	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
watery	1
hole	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
but	1
had	1
felt	1
out	1
and	1
found	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
legs	1
the	1
leg	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
held	1
within	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
crocodile	1
was	1
badly	1
lacerated	1
but	1
the	1
bone	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
broken	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
muscles	1
or	1
tendons	1
sufficiently	1
injured	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
useless	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
excruciating	1
pain	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
but	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
pain	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
no	1
further	1
thought	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
was	1
not	1
greatly	1
impaired	1
by	1
the	1
sharp	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
monster	1
rapidly	1
he	1
crawled	1
and	1
swam	1
through	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
inclined	1
downward	1
and	1
finally	1
upward	1
to	1
open	1
at	1
last	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
bottom	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
line	1
as	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
reached	1
the	1
surface	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
two	1
great	1
crocodiles	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
rapidly	1
in	1
his	1
direction	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
superhuman	1
effort	1
the	1
man	1
struck	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
overhanging	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
near	1
by	1
tree	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
a	1
moment	1
too	1
soon	1
for	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
drawn	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
limb	1
than	1
two	1
gaping	1
mouths	1
snapped	1
venomously	1
below	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
tarzan	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
tree	1
that	1
had	1
proved	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
his	1
salvation	1
his	1
eyes	1
scanned	1
the	1
river	1
as	1
far	1
down	1
stream	1
as	1
the	1
tortuous	1
channel	1
would	1
permit	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
or	1
his	1
dugout	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
rested	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
his	1
wounded	1
leg	1
he	1
started	1
on	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
drifting	1
canoe	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
that	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
stream	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
quarry	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
it	1
made	1
little	1
difference	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
upon	1
which	1
side	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
pursuit	1
to	1
his	1
intense	1
chagrin	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
leg	1
was	1
more	1
badly	1
injured	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
that	1
its	1
condition	1
seriously	1
impeded	1
his	1
progress	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
difficulty	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
proceed	1
faster	1
than	1
a	1
walk	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
he	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
impeded	1
his	1
progress	1
but	1
rendered	1
travelling	1
distinctly	1
dangerous	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
negress	1
tambudza	1
tarzan	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
suggestion	1
that	1
now	1
filled	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
doubts	1
and	1
misgivings	1
when	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
s	1
death	1
she	1
had	1
also	1
added	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
woman	1
though	1
grief	1
stricken	1
had	1
confided	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
baby	1
was	1
not	1
hers	1
tarzan	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
jane	1
could	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
deny	1
her	1
identity	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
the	1
only	1
explanation	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
white	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
accompanied	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
swede	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
fastness	1
of	1
the	1
interior	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
jane	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
gave	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
problem	1
the	1
more	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
he	1
became	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
still	1
safe	1
in	1
london	1
and	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
fate	1
that	1
had	1
overtaken	1
her	1
first	1
born	1
after	1
all	1
then	1
his	1
interpretation	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
sinister	1
taunt	1
had	1
been	1
erroneous	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
bearing	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
a	1
double	1
apprehension	1
needlessly	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
thought	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
from	1
this	1
belief	1
he	1
garnered	1
some	1
slight	1
surcease	1
from	1
the	1
numbing	1
grief	1
that	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
son	1
had	1
thrust	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
death	1
even	1
the	1
savage	1
beast	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
tarzan	1
inured	1
to	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
grim	1
jungle	1
shuddered	1
as	1
he	1
contemplated	1
the	1
hideous	1
fate	1
that	1
had	1
overtaken	1
the	1
innocent	1
child	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
painfully	1
towards	1
the	1
coast	1
he	1
let	1
his	1
mind	1
dwell	1
so	1
constantly	1
upon	1
the	1
frightful	1
crimes	1
which	1
the	1
russian	1
had	1
perpetrated	1
against	1
his	1
loved	1
ones	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
scar	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead	1
stood	1
out	1
almost	1
continuously	1
in	1
the	1
vivid	1
scarlet	1
that	1
marked	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
most	1
relentless	1
and	1
bestial	1
moods	1
of	1
rage	1
at	1
times	1
he	1
startled	1
even	1
himself	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
lesser	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
jungle	1
scampering	1
to	1
their	1
hiding	1
places	1
as	1
involuntary	1
roars	1
and	1
growls	1
rumbled	1
from	1
his	1
throat	1
could	1
he	1
but	1
lay	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
russian	1
twice	1
upon	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
bellicose	1
natives	1
ran	1
threateningly	1
from	1
their	1
villages	1
to	1
bar	1
his	1
further	1
progress	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
awful	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
bull	1
ape	1
thundered	1
upon	1
their	1
affrighted	1
ears	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
white	1
giant	1
charged	1
bellowing	1
upon	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
bush	1
nor	1
ventured	1
thence	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
safely	1
passed	1
though	1
his	1
progress	1
seemed	1
tantalizingly	1
slow	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
whose	1
idea	1
of	1
speed	1
had	1
been	1
gained	1
by	1
such	1
standards	1
as	1
the	1
lesser	1
apes	1
attain	1
he	1
made	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
almost	1
as	1
rapid	1
progress	1
as	1
the	1
drifting	1
canoe	1
that	1
bore	1
rokoff	1
on	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
bay	1
and	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
just	1
after	1
darkness	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
jane	1
clayton	1
and	1
the	1
russian	1
ended	1
their	1
flights	1
from	1
the	1
interior	1
the	1
darkness	1
lowered	1
so	1
heavily	1
upon	1
the	1
black	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
encircling	1
jungle	1
that	1
tarzan	1
even	1
with	1
eyes	1
accustomed	1
to	1
much	1
use	1
after	1
dark	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
nothing	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
from	1
him	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
shore	1
that	1
night	1
for	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
certain	1
must	1
have	1
preceded	1
rokoff	1
down	1
the	1
ugambi	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
or	1
other	1
ship	1
lay	1
at	1
anchor	1
but	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dream	1
for	1
no	1
light	1
showed	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
steamer	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
commenced	1
his	1
search	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
suddenly	1
attracted	1
by	1
a	1
noise	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
perceived	1
the	1
stealthy	1
dip	1
of	1
paddles	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
about	1
opposite	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
stood	1
motionless	1
as	1
a	1
statue	1
he	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
faint	1
sound	1
presently	1
it	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
shuffling	1
noise	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
trained	1
ears	1
could	1
interpret	1
as	1
resulting	1
from	1
but	1
a	1
single	1
cause	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
leather	1
shod	1
feet	1
upon	1
the	1
rounds	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
monkey	1
ladder	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
ship	1
there	1
nor	1
might	1
there	1
be	1
one	1
within	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
thus	1
peering	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
enshrouded	1
night	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
water	1
like	1
a	1
slap	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
unexpected	1
was	1
it	1
the	1
sharp	1
staccato	1
of	1
an	1
exchange	1
of	1
shots	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
wounded	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
recent	1
horrible	1
experience	1
still	1
strong	1
upon	1
him	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
did	1
not	1
hesitate	1
as	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
that	1
frightened	1
cry	1
rose	1
shrill	1
and	1
piercing	1
upon	1
the	1
still	1
night	1
air	1
with	1
a	1
bound	1
he	1
cleared	1
the	1
intervening	1
bush	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
splash	1
as	1
the	1
water	1
closed	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
powerful	1
strokes	1
he	1
swam	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
impenetrable	1
night	1
with	1
no	1
guide	1
save	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
an	1
illusive	1
cry	1
and	1
for	1
company	1
the	1
hideous	1
denizens	1
of	1
an	1
equatorial	1
river	1
the	1
boat	1
that	1
had	1
attracted	1
jane	1
s	1
attention	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
guard	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
had	1
been	1
perceived	1
by	1
rokoff	1
upon	1
one	1
bank	1
and	1
mugambi	1
and	1
the	1
horde	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
dugout	1
first	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
after	1
a	1
conference	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
toward	1
the	1
kincaid	1
but	1
before	1
ever	1
it	1
covered	1
half	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
the	1
steamer	1
a	1
rifle	1
had	1
spoken	1
from	1
the	1
latter	1
s	1
deck	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
had	1
crumpled	1
and	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
more	1
slowly	1
and	1
presently	1
when	1
jane	1
s	1
rifle	1
had	1
found	1
another	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
the	1
canoe	1
withdrew	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
where	1
it	1
lay	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
daylight	1
lasted	1
the	1
savage	1
snarling	1
pack	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
shore	1
had	1
been	1
directed	1
in	1
their	1
pursuit	1
by	1
the	1
black	1
warrior	1
mugambi	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
wagambi	1
only	1
he	1
knew	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
foe	1
and	1
which	1
friend	1
of	1
their	1
lost	1
master	1
could	1
they	1
have	1
reached	1
either	1
the	1
canoe	1
or	1
the	1
kincaid	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
short	1
work	1
of	1
any	1
whom	1
they	1
found	1
there	1
but	1
the	1
gulf	1
of	1
black	1
water	1
intervening	1
shut	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
farther	1
advance	1
as	1
effectually	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
broad	1
ocean	1
that	1
separated	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
prey	1
mugambi	1
knew	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
occurrences	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
landing	1
of	1
tarzan	1
upon	1
jungle	1
island	1
and	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
whites	1
up	1
the	1
ugambi	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
savage	1
master	1
sought	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
child	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
stolen	1
by	1
the	1
wicked	1
white	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
followed	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
and	1
now	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
he	1
believed	1
also	1
that	1
this	1
same	1
man	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
great	1
white	1
giant	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
respect	1
and	1
love	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
the	1
greatest	1
chiefs	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
breast	1
of	1
mugambi	1
burned	1
an	1
iron	1
resolve	1
to	1
win	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
one	1
and	1
wreak	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
canoe	1
come	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
take	1
in	1
rokoff	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
kincaid	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
only	1
by	1
possessing	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
canoe	1
could	1
he	1
hope	1
to	1
transport	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
pack	1
within	1
striking	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
so	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
even	1
before	1
jane	1
clayton	1
fired	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
into	1
rokoff	1
s	1
canoe	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
tarzan	1
had	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
after	1
the	1
russian	1
and	1
his	1
party	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
paulvitch	1
and	1
the	1
several	1
men	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
upon	1
the	1
kincaid	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
coaling	1
had	1
retreated	1
before	1
her	1
fire	1
jane	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
temporary	1
respite	1
from	1
their	1
attentions	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
conviction	1
came	1
a	1
determination	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
final	1
stroke	1
for	1
freedom	1
from	1
the	1
menacing	1
threat	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
evil	1
purpose	1
with	1
this	1
idea	1
in	1
view	1
she	1
opened	1
negotiations	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
sailors	1
she	1
had	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
and	1
having	1
forced	1
their	1
consent	1
to	1
her	1
plans	1
upon	1
pain	1
of	1
death	1
should	1
they	1
attempt	1
disloyalty	1
she	1
released	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
darkness	1
closed	1
about	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
ready	1
revolver	1
to	1
compel	1
obedience	1
she	1
let	1
them	1
up	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
searching	1
them	1
carefully	1
for	1
concealed	1
weapons	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
with	1
hands	1
elevated	1
above	1
their	1
heads	1
once	1
satisfied	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
unarmed	1
she	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
work	1
cutting	1
the	1
cable	1
which	1
held	1
the	1
kincaid	1
to	1
her	1
anchorage	1
for	1
her	1
bold	1
plan	1
was	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
steamer	1
adrift	1
and	1
float	1
with	1
her	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
there	1
to	1
trust	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
elements	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
confident	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
merciless	1
than	1
nikolas	1
rokoff	1
should	1
he	1
again	1
capture	1
her	1
there	1
was	1
too	1
the	1
chance	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
might	1
be	1
sighted	1
by	1
some	1
passing	1
ship	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
well	1
stocked	1
with	1
provisions	1
and	1
water	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
storm	1
was	1
well	1
over	1
she	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
eventual	1
success	1
of	1
her	1
plan	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
deeply	1
overcast	1
heavy	1
clouds	1
riding	1
low	1
above	1
the	1
jungle	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
where	1
the	1
broad	1
ocean	1
spread	1
beyond	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
mouth	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
suggestion	1
of	1
lessening	1
gloom	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
night	1
for	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
hand	1
her	1
enemies	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
activity	1
aboard	1
the	1
ship	1
nor	1
mark	1
her	1
course	1
as	1
the	1
swift	1
current	1
bore	1
her	1
outward	1
into	1
the	1
ocean	1
before	1
daylight	1
broke	1
the	1
ebb	1
tide	1
would	1
have	1
carried	1
the	1
kincaid	1
well	1
into	1
the	1
benguela	1
current	1
which	1
flows	1
northward	1
along	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
africa	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
south	1
wind	1
was	1
prevailing	1
jane	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
before	1
rokoff	1
could	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
steamer	1
standing	1
over	1
the	1
labouring	1
seamen	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
breathed	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
strand	1
of	1
the	1
cable	1
parted	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
maw	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
ugambi	1
with	1
her	1
two	1
prisoners	1
still	1
beneath	1
the	1
coercing	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
rifle	1
she	1
ordered	1
them	1
upon	1
deck	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
again	1
imprisoning	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
she	1
permitted	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
their	1
promises	1
of	1
loyalty	1
and	1
the	1
arguments	1
which	1
they	1
put	1
forth	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
permitted	1
them	1
to	1
remain	1
above	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
kincaid	1
drifted	1
rapidly	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
grinding	1
jar	1
she	1
stopped	1
in	1
midstream	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
run	1
upon	1
a	1
low	1
lying	1
bar	1
that	1
splits	1
the	1
channel	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
she	1
hung	1
there	1
and	1
then	1
swinging	1
round	1
until	1
her	1
bow	1
pointed	1
toward	1
the	1
shore	1
she	1
broke	1
adrift	1
once	1
more	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
just	1
as	1
jane	1
clayton	1
was	1
congratulating	1
herself	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
free	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
ears	1
from	1
a	1
point	1
up	1
the	1
river	1
about	1
where	1
the	1
kincaid	1
had	1
been	1
anchored	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
s	1
scream	1
shrill	1
piercing	1
fear	1
laden	1
the	1
sailors	1
heard	1
the	1
shots	1
with	1
certain	1
conviction	1
that	1
they	1
announced	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
their	1
employer	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
relish	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
that	1
would	1
consign	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
a	1
drifting	1
derelict	1
they	1
whispered	1
together	1
a	1
hurried	1
plan	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
and	1
hail	1
rokoff	1
and	1
their	1
companions	1
to	1
their	1
rescue	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
fate	1
would	1
play	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
guns	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
attention	1
had	1
been	1
distracted	1
from	1
her	1
unwilling	1
assistants	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
keeping	1
one	1
eye	1
upon	1
them	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
intended	1
doing	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
to	1
peer	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
toward	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
disturbance	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
bosom	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
off	1
her	1
guard	1
the	1
two	1
sailors	1
crept	1
stealthily	1
upon	1
her	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
scraping	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
shoes	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
startled	1
the	1
girl	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
appreciation	1
of	1
her	1
danger	1
but	1
the	1
warning	1
had	1
come	1
too	1
late	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
both	1
men	1
leaped	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
bore	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
beneath	1
them	1
she	1
saw	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
lesser	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
another	1
man	1
clamber	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
pains	1
her	1
heroic	1
struggle	1
for	1
freedom	1
had	1
failed	1
with	1
a	1
stifled	1
sob	1
she	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
unequal	1
battle	1
chapter	1
17	1
on	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
when	1
mugambi	1
had	1
turned	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
the	1
pack	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
definite	1
purpose	1
in	1
view	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
dugout	1
wherewith	1
to	1
transport	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
tarzan	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
long	1
in	1
coming	1
upon	1
the	1
object	1
which	1
he	1
sought	1
just	1
at	1
dusk	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
canoe	1
moored	1
to	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
tributary	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
at	1
a	1
point	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
one	1
without	1
loss	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
piled	1
his	1
hideous	1
fellows	1
into	1
the	1
craft	1
and	1
shoved	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
stream	1
so	1
quickly	1
had	1
they	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
canoe	1
that	1
the	1
warrior	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
occupied	1
the	1
huddled	1
figure	1
sleeping	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
had	1
entirely	1
escaped	1
his	1
observation	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
that	1
had	1
now	1
fallen	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
were	1
they	1
afloat	1
than	1
a	1
savage	1
growling	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
directly	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
dugout	1
attracted	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
a	1
shivering	1
and	1
cowering	1
figure	1
that	1
trembled	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
anthropoid	1
to	1
mugambi	1
s	1
astonishment	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
native	1
woman	1
with	1
difficulty	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
ape	1
from	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
succeeded	1
in	1
quelling	1
her	1
fears	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
fleeing	1
from	1
marriage	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
she	1
loathed	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
refuge	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
edge	1
mugambi	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
her	1
presence	1
but	1
there	1
she	1
was	1
and	1
rather	1
than	1
lose	1
time	1
by	1
returning	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
the	1
black	1
permitted	1
her	1
to	1
remain	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
canoe	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
his	1
awkward	1
companions	1
could	1
paddle	1
the	1
dugout	1
down	1
stream	1
toward	1
the	1
ugambi	1
and	1
the	1
kincaid	1
they	1
moved	1
through	1
the	1
darkness	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
mugambi	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
shadowy	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
steamer	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
ocean	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
apparent	1
than	1
to	1
one	1
upon	1
either	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
to	1
note	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
receding	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
finally	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
moving	1
down	1
stream	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
urge	1
his	1
creatures	1
to	1
renewed	1
efforts	1
to	1
overtake	1
the	1
steamer	1
the	1
outline	1
of	1
another	1
canoe	1
burst	1
suddenly	1
into	1
view	1
not	1
three	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
craft	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
occupants	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
discovered	1
the	1
proximity	1
of	1
mugambi	1
s	1
horde	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
recognize	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
fearful	1
crew	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
oncoming	1
boat	1
challenged	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
dugouts	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
touch	1
for	1
answer	1
came	1
the	1
menacing	1
growl	1
of	1
a	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
fellow	1
found	1
himself	1
gazing	1
into	1
the	1
flaming	1
eyes	1
of	1
sheeta	1
who	1
had	1
raised	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
forepaws	1
upon	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
ready	1
to	1
leap	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
occupants	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
craft	1
instantly	1
rokoff	1
realized	1
the	1
peril	1
that	1
confronted	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
quick	1
command	1
to	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
occupants	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
canoe	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
volley	1
and	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
the	1
terrified	1
native	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
canoe	1
with	1
mugambi	1
that	1
both	1
tarzan	1
and	1
jane	1
had	1
heard	1
before	1
the	1
slower	1
and	1
less	1
skilled	1
paddlers	1
in	1
mugambi	1
s	1
canoe	1
could	1
press	1
their	1
advantage	1
and	1
effect	1
a	1
boarding	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
turned	1
swiftly	1
down	1
stream	1
and	1
were	1
paddling	1
for	1
their	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
visible	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
vessel	1
after	1
striking	1
upon	1
the	1
bar	1
had	1
swung	1
loose	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
slow	1
moving	1
eddy	1
which	1
returns	1
up	1
stream	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
southern	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
only	1
to	1
circle	1
out	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
join	1
the	1
downward	1
flow	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
or	1
so	1
farther	1
up	1
thus	1
the	1
kincaid	1
was	1
returning	1
jane	1
clayton	1
directly	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
her	1
enemies	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
as	1
tarzan	1
sprang	1
into	1
the	1
river	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
not	1
visible	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
swam	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
a	1
ship	1
drifted	1
so	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
sounds	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
canoes	1
as	1
he	1
swam	1
he	1
had	1
vivid	1
recollections	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
occasion	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
swum	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
sudden	1
shudder	1
shook	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
twice	1
felt	1
something	1
brush	1
his	1
legs	1
from	1
the	1
slimy	1
depths	1
below	1
him	1
nothing	1
seized	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
he	1
quite	1
forgot	1
about	1
crocodiles	1
in	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
dark	1
mass	1
loom	1
suddenly	1
before	1
him	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
open	1
river	1
so	1
close	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
strokes	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
thing	1
when	1
to	1
his	1
amazement	1
his	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
came	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
as	1
the	1
agile	1
ape	1
man	1
clambered	1
over	1
the	1
vessel	1
s	1
rail	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
sensitive	1
ears	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
struggle	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
deck	1
noiselessly	1
he	1
sped	1
across	1
the	1
intervening	1
space	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
risen	1
now	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
still	1
banked	1
with	1
clouds	1
a	1
lesser	1
darkness	1
enveloped	1
the	1
scene	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
blotted	1
out	1
all	1
sight	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
his	1
keen	1
eyes	1
therefore	1
saw	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
two	1
men	1
grappling	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
accompanied	1
anderssen	1
toward	1
the	1
interior	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
though	1
he	1
suspected	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
upon	1
which	1
chance	1
had	1
led	1
him	1
but	1
he	1
wasted	1
little	1
time	1
in	1
idle	1
speculation	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
harm	1
from	1
two	1
ruffians	1
which	1
was	1
enough	1
excuse	1
for	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
to	1
project	1
his	1
giant	1
thews	1
into	1
the	1
conflict	1
without	1
further	1
investigation	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
sailors	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
force	1
at	1
work	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
the	1
falling	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand	1
upon	1
a	1
shoulder	1
of	1
each	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
grip	1
of	1
a	1
fly	1
wheel	1
they	1
were	1
jerked	1
suddenly	1
from	1
their	1
prey	1
what	1
means	1
this	1
asked	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
in	1
their	1
ears	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
reply	1
however	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
voice	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
had	1
sprung	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
joy	1
leaped	1
toward	1
their	1
assailant	1
tarzan	1
she	1
cried	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
hurled	1
the	1
two	1
sailors	1
across	1
the	1
deck	1
where	1
they	1
rolled	1
stunned	1
and	1
terrified	1
into	1
the	1
scuppers	1
upon	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
incredulity	1
gathered	1
the	1
girl	1
into	1
his	1
arms	1
brief	1
however	1
were	1
the	1
moments	1
for	1
their	1
greeting	1
scarcely	1
had	1
they	1
recognized	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
the	1
clouds	1
above	1
them	1
parted	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
men	1
clambering	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
to	1
the	1
steamer	1
s	1
deck	1
foremost	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
russian	1
as	1
the	1
brilliant	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
equatorial	1
moon	1
lighted	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
he	1
realized	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
before	1
him	1
was	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
he	1
screamed	1
hysterical	1
commands	1
to	1
his	1
followers	1
to	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
tarzan	1
pushed	1
jane	1
behind	1
the	1
cabin	1
near	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
bound	1
started	1
for	1
rokoff	1
the	1
men	1
behind	1
the	1
russian	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
raised	1
their	1
rifles	1
and	1
fired	1
at	1
the	1
charging	1
ape	1
man	1
but	1
those	1
behind	1
them	1
were	1
otherwise	1
engaged	1
for	1
up	1
the	1
monkey	1
ladder	1
in	1
their	1
rear	1
was	1
thronging	1
a	1
hideous	1
horde	1
first	1
came	1
five	1
snarling	1
apes	1
huge	1
manlike	1
beasts	1
with	1
bared	1
fangs	1
and	1
slavering	1
jaws	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
a	1
giant	1
black	1
warrior	1
his	1
long	1
spear	1
gleaming	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight	1
behind	1
him	1
again	1
scrambled	1
another	1
creature	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
horrid	1
horde	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
they	1
most	1
feared	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
with	1
gleaming	1
jaws	1
agape	1
and	1
fiery	1
eyes	1
blazing	1
at	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mightiness	1
of	1
his	1
hate	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
blood	1
lust	1
the	1
shots	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
fired	1
at	1
tarzan	1
missed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
upon	1
rokoff	1
in	1
another	1
instant	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
great	1
coward	1
dodged	1
backward	1
between	1
his	1
two	1
henchmen	1
and	1
screaming	1
in	1
hysterical	1
terror	1
bolted	1
forward	1
toward	1
the	1
forecastle	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
tarzan	1
s	1
attention	1
was	1
distracted	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
before	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
pursue	1
the	1
russian	1
about	1
him	1
the	1
apes	1
and	1
mugambi	1
were	1
battling	1
with	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
party	1
beneath	1
the	1
terrible	1
ferocity	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
soon	1
scampering	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
those	1
who	1
still	1
lived	1
to	1
scamper	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
fangs	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
and	1
the	1
tearing	1
talons	1
of	1
sheeta	1
already	1
had	1
found	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
single	1
victim	1
four	1
however	1
escaped	1
and	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
barricade	1
themselves	1
against	1
further	1
assault	1
here	1
they	1
found	1
rokoff	1
and	1
enraged	1
at	1
his	1
desertion	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
moment	1
of	1
peril	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
uniformly	1
brutal	1
treatment	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
wont	1
to	1
accord	1
them	1
they	1
gloated	1
upon	1
the	1
opportunity	1
now	1
offered	1
them	1
to	1
revenge	1
themselves	1
in	1
part	1
upon	1
their	1
hated	1
employer	1
despite	1
his	1
prayers	1
and	1
grovelling	1
pleas	1
therefore	1
they	1
hurled	1
him	1
bodily	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
delivering	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
fearful	1
things	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
themselves	1
just	1
escaped	1
tarzan	1
saw	1
the	1
man	1
emerge	1
from	1
the	1
forecastle	1
saw	1
and	1
recognized	1
his	1
enemy	1
but	1
another	1
saw	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
soon	1
it	1
was	1
sheeta	1
and	1
with	1
grinning	1
jaws	1
the	1
mighty	1
beast	1
slunk	1
silently	1
toward	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
man	1
when	1
rokoff	1
saw	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
stalked	1
him	1
his	1
shrieks	1
for	1
help	1
filled	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
with	1
trembling	1
knees	1
he	1
stood	1
as	1
one	1
paralyzed	1
before	1
the	1
hideous	1
death	1
that	1
was	1
creeping	1
upon	1
him	1
tarzan	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
toward	1
the	1
russian	1
his	1
brain	1
burning	1
with	1
a	1
raging	1
fire	1
of	1
vengeance	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
murderer	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
at	1
his	1
mercy	1
his	1
was	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
avenge	1
once	1
jane	1
had	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
law	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
power	1
and	1
mete	1
to	1
rokoff	1
the	1
death	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
merited	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
none	1
should	1
stay	1
him	1
his	1
fingers	1
clenched	1
and	1
unclenched	1
spasmodically	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
trembling	1
russ	1
beastlike	1
and	1
ominous	1
as	1
a	1
brute	1
of	1
prey	1
presently	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
sheeta	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
forestall	1
him	1
robbing	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
hate	1
he	1
called	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
a	1
hideous	1
spell	1
that	1
had	1
held	1
the	1
russian	1
galvanized	1
him	1
into	1
sudden	1
action	1
with	1
a	1
scream	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
toward	1
the	1
bridge	1
after	1
him	1
pounced	1
sheeta	1
the	1
panther	1
unmindful	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
s	1
warning	1
voice	1
tarzan	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leap	1
after	1
the	1
two	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
light	1
touch	1
upon	1
his	1
arm	1
turning	1
he	1
found	1
jane	1
at	1
his	1
elbow	1

not	1
leave	1
me	1
she	1
whispered	1

glanced	1
behind	1
her	1
all	1
about	1
were	1
the	1
hideous	1
apes	1
of	1

some	1
even	1
were	1
approaching	1
the	1
young	1
woman	1
with	1
bared	1
fangs	1
and	1
menacing	1
guttural	1
warnings	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
warned	1
them	1
back	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
these	1
were	1
but	1
beasts	1
unable	1
to	1
differentiate	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
his	1
foes	1
their	1
savage	1
natures	1
were	1
roused	1
by	1
their	1
recent	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
sailors	1
and	1
now	1
all	1
flesh	1
outside	1
the	1
pack	1
was	1
meat	1
to	1
them	1
tarzan	1
turned	1
again	1
toward	1
the	1
russian	1
chagrined	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
forgo	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
personal	1
revenge	1
unless	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
escape	1
sheeta	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
had	1
retreated	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
where	1
he	1
now	1
stood	1
trembling	1
and	1
wide	1

moved	1
slowly	1
toward	1

petrified	1
his	1

protruding	1
from	1

sockets	1
his	1
mouth	1
agape	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
sweat	1
of	1
terror	1
clammy	1
upon	1
his	1
brow	1
below	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
great	1

direction	1
in	1

even	1
now	1
one	1
of	1

leaping	1
to	1
seize	1

draw	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1

broke	1
in	1
inarticulate	1
shrieks	1
with	1
a	1

piercing	1
wail	1

sank	1
to	1
his	1

full	1
upon	1

satisfaction	1

upon	1

had	1
burned	1
scarlet	1
faded	1
to	1
the	1

hue	1
of	1

give	1
what	1

the	1

with	1

at	1
the	1
rejection	1
of	1

paulvitch	1
arrived	1
always	1
at	1
the	1

conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
accomplish	1
naught	1

half	1

separated	1
him	1
from	1

was	1
he	1
to	1
span	1

there	1
was	1
no	1
canoe	1
nearer	1
than	1
the	1

and	1
paulvitch	1
was	1
none	1
too	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
at	1
anchor	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
should	1
he	1
take	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
traverse	1
the	1
jungle	1
to	1
the	1
distant	1
village	1
and	1
return	1
with	1
a	1

yet	1
there	1
was	1
no	1

so	1
convinced	1
that	1

alone	1
might	1

turned	1
away	1
from	1

hastening	1
through	1

dense	1
jungle	1
his	1
mind	1
centred	1
upon	1
his	1
one	1
fetich	1
revenge	1
the	1
russian	1
forgot	1
even	1
his	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
his	1

paulvitch	1
was	1
yet	1
so	1
blind	1
as	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
his	1
greatest	1
happiness	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
the	1
plottings	1
and	1
schemings	1
which	1
had	1
ever	1
brought	1
him	1

to	1
disaster	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
finally	1
to	1
a	1
hideous	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
russian	1
stumbled	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
toward	1
the	1
mosula	1
village	1
there	1
presently	1
crystallized	1
within	1
his	1
brain	1
a	1
plan	1
which	1
seemed	1
more	1
feasible	1
than	1
any	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
considered	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
and	1
once	1
aboard	1
would	1
search	1
out	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
original	1
crew	1
who	1
had	1
survived	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
this	1
frightful	1
expedition	1
and	1
enlist	1
them	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
wrest	1
the	1
vessel	1
from	1
tarzan	1
and	1
his	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
were	1
arms	1
and	1
ammunition	1
and	1
hidden	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
receptacle	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
table	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
infernal	1
machines	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
occupied	1
much	1
of	1
paulvitch	1
s	1
spare	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
stood	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
nihilists	1
of	1
his	1
native	1
land	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
sold	1
them	1
out	1
for	1
immunity	1
and	1
gold	1
to	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
petrograd	1
paulvitch	1
winced	1
as	1
he	1
recalled	1
the	1
denunciation	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
comrades	1
ere	1
the	1
poor	1
devil	1
expiated	1
his	1
political	1
sins	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
hempen	1
rope	1
but	1
the	1
infernal	1
machine	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
much	1
with	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
but	1
get	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
it	1
within	1
the	1
little	1
hardwood	1
case	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
table	1
rested	1
sufficient	1
potential	1
destructiveness	1
to	1
wipe	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
every	1
enemy	1
aboard	1
the	1
kincaid	1
paulvitch	1
licked	1
his	1
lips	1
in	1
anticipatory	1
joy	1
and	1
urged	1
his	1
tired	1
legs	1
to	1
greater	1
speed	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
anchorage	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
designs	1
all	1
depended	1
of	1
course	1
upon	1
when	1
the	1
kincaid	1
departed	1
the	1
russian	1
realized	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
accomplished	1
beneath	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
darkness	1
must	1
shroud	1
his	1
approach	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
for	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
sighted	1
by	1
tarzan	1
or	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
chance	1
to	1
board	1
the	1
vessel	1
the	1
gale	1
that	1
was	1
blowing	1
was	1
he	1
believed	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
delay	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1
kincaid	1
under	1
way	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
continued	1
to	1
blow	1
until	1
night	1
then	1
the	1
chances	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
likelihood	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
attempting	1
to	1
navigate	1
the	1
tortuous	1
channel	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
while	1
darkness	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
hiding	1
the	1
many	1
bars	1
and	1
the	1
numerous	1
small	1
islands	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
expanse	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
mouth	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
after	1
noon	1
when	1
paulvitch	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
mosula	1
village	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
tributary	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
suspicion	1
and	1
unfriendliness	1
by	1
the	1
native	1
chief	1
who	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
rokoff	1
or	1
paulvitch	1
had	1
suffered	1
in	1
some	1
manner	1
from	1
the	1
greed	1
the	1
cruelty	1
or	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
muscovites	1
when	1
paulvitch	1
demanded	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
canoe	1
the	1
chief	1
grumbled	1
a	1
surly	1
refusal	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
surrounded	1
by	1
angry	1
muttering	1
warriors	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
waiting	1
some	1
slight	1
pretext	1
to	1
transfix	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
menacing	1
spears	1
the	1
russian	1
could	1
do	1
naught	1
else	1
than	1
withdraw	1
a	1
dozen	1
fighting	1
men	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
clearing	1
leaving	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
warning	1
never	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
their	1
village	1
stifling	1
his	1
anger	1
paulvitch	1
slunk	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
but	1
once	1
beyond	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
warriors	1
he	1
paused	1
and	1
listened	1
intently	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
his	1
escort	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
following	1
him	1
he	1
wormed	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
bushes	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
still	1
determined	1
some	1
way	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
canoe	1
life	1
itself	1
depended	1
upon	1
his	1
reaching	1
the	1
kincaid	1
and	1
enlisting	1
the	1
survivors	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
crew	1
in	1
his	1
service	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
abandoned	1
here	1
amidst	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
african	1
jungle	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
enmity	1
of	1
the	1
natives	1
was	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
practically	1
equivalent	1
to	1
a	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
a	1
desire	1
for	1
revenge	1
acted	1
as	1
an	1
almost	1
equally	1
powerful	1
incentive	1
to	1
spur	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
accomplish	1
his	1
design	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
desperate	1
man	1
that	1
lay	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
foliage	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
river	1
searching	1
with	1
eager	1
eyes	1
for	1
some	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
canoe	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
easily	1
handled	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
paddle	1
nor	1
had	1
the	1
russian	1
long	1
to	1
wait	1
before	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
awkward	1
little	1
skiffs	1
which	1
the	1
mosula	1
fashion	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
upon	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
a	1
youth	1
was	1
paddling	1
lazily	1
out	1
into	1
midstream	1
from	1
a	1
point	1
beside	1
the	1
village	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
channel	1
he	1
allowed	1
the	1
sluggish	1
current	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
slowly	1
along	1
while	1
he	1
lolled	1
indolently	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
crude	1
canoe	1
all	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
unseen	1
enemy	1
upon	1
the	1
river	1
s	1
bank	1
the	1
lad	1
floated	1
slowly	1
down	1
the	1
stream	1
while	1
paulvitch	1
followed	1
along	1
the	1
jungle	1
path	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
mile	1
below	1
the	1
village	1
the	1
black	1
boy	1
dipped	1
his	1
paddle	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
forced	1
his	1
skiff	1
toward	1
the	1
bank	1
paulvitch	1
elated	1
by	1
the	1
chance	1
which	1
had	1
drawn	1
the	1
youth	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
as	1
that	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
followed	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1

the	1

touch	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

must	1
for	1

he	1
drew	1

beneath	1
an	1
overhanging	1
limb	1
of	1
a	1
great	1

to	1
implant	1
a	1
farewell	1

upon	1
the	1

the	1
departing	1

with	1
green	1

alexander	1

it	1
was	1
indeed	1
dire	1
necessity	1
which	1
goaded	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
action	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
time	1
just	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1

nightfall	1
would	1
the	1
black	1
fool	1
never	1
quit	1
his	1
skiff	1
paulvitch	1
squirmed	1
and	1
fidgeted	1
the	1
lad	1
yawned	1
and	1
stretched	1
with	1
exasperating	1
deliberateness	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
arrows	1
in	1
his	1
quiver	1
tested	1
his	1
bow	1
and	1
looked	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
upon	1
the	1
hunting	1
knife	1
in	1
his	1
loin	1
cloth	1
again	1
he	1
stretched	1
and	1
yawned	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
river	1

shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
canoe	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
nap	1
before	1
he	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
after	1
the	1
prey	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
hunt	1
paulvitch	1
half	1
rose	1
and	1
with	1
tensed	1
muscles	1
stood	1
glaring	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
unsuspecting	1
victim	1
the	1
boy	1
s	1
lids	1
drooped	1
and	1
closed	1
presently	1
his	1
breast	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
deep	1
breaths	1
of	1
slumber	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
the	1
russian	1
crept	1
stealthily	1
nearer	1
a	1
branch	1
rustled	1
beneath	1
his	1
weight	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
stirred	1
in	1
his	1
sleep	1
paulvitch	1
drew	1
his	1
revolver	1
and	1
levelled	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
black	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
rigid	1
quiet	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
the	1
youth	1
relapsed	1
into	1
undisturbed	1
slumber	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
crept	1
closer	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
chance	1
a	1
shot	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
risk	1
of	1
missing	1
presently	1
he	1
leaned	1
close	1
above	1
the	1
mosula	1
the	1
cold	1
steel	1
of	1
the	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
insinuated	1
itself	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
the	1
unconscious	1
lad	1
now	1
it	1
stopped	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
above	1
the	1
strongly	1
beating	1
heart	1
but	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
a	1
finger	1
lay	1
between	1
the	1
harmless	1
boy	1
and	1
eternity	1
the	1
soft	1
bloom	1
of	1
youth	1
still	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
brown	1
cheek	1
a	1
smile	1
half	1
parted	1
the	1
beardless	1
lips	1
did	1
any	1
qualm	1
of	1
conscience	1
point	1
its	1
disquieting	1
finger	1
of	1
reproach	1
at	1
the	1
murderer	1
to	1
all	1
such	1
was	1
alexander	1
paulvitch	1
immune	1
a	1
sneer	1
curled	1
his	1
bearded	1
lip	1
as	1
his	1
forefinger	1
closed	1
upon	1
the	1
trigger	1
of	1
his	1
revolver	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
loud	1
report	1
a	1
little	1
hole	1
appeared	1
above	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
sleeping	1
boy	1
a	1
little	1
hole	1
about	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
blackened	1
rim	1
of	1
powder	1
burned	1
flesh	1
the	1
youthful	1
body	1
half	1
rose	1
to	1
a	1
sitting	1
posture	1
the	1
smiling	1
lips	1
tensed	1
to	1
the	1
nervous	1
shock	1
of	1
a	1
momentary	1
agony	1
which	1
the	1
conscious	1
mind	1
never	1
apprehended	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
dead	1
sank	1
limply	1
back	1
into	1
that	1
deepest	1
of	1
slumbers	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
awakening	1
the	1
killer	1
dropped	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
skiff	1
beside	1
the	1
killed	1
ruthless	1
hands	1
seized	1
the	1
dead	1
boy	1
heartlessly	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
low	1
gunwale	1
a	1
little	1
shove	1
a	1
splash	1
some	1
widening	1
ripples	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
sudden	1
surge	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
hidden	1
body	1
from	1
the	1
slimy	1
depths	1
and	1
the	1
coveted	1
canoe	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sole	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
man	1
more	1
savage	1
than	1
the	1
youth	1
whose	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
casting	1
off	1
the	1
tie	1
rope	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
paddle	1
paulvitch	1
bent	1
feverishly	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
driving	1
the	1
skiff	1
downward	1
toward	1
the	1
ugambi	1
at	1
top	1
speed	1
night	1
had	1
fallen	1
when	1
the	1
prow	1
of	1
the	1
bloodstained	1
craft	1
shot	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
stream	1
constantly	1
the	1
russian	1
strained	1
his	1
eyes	1
into	1
the	1
increasing	1
darkness	1
ahead	1
in	1
vain	1
endeavour	1
to	1
pierce	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
which	1
lay	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
anchorage	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
was	1
the	1
ship	1
still	1
riding	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
or	1
had	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
at	1
last	1
persuaded	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
venturing	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
abating	1
storm	1
as	1
paulvitch	1
forged	1
ahead	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
beside	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
disquieting	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
those	1
which	1
related	1
to	1
his	1
future	1
should	1
it	1
chance	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
had	1
already	1
steamed	1
away	1
leaving	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
merciless	1
horrors	1
of	1
the	1
savage	1
wilderness	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
paddler	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fairly	1
flying	1
over	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
moorings	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
passed	1
the	1
spot	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
lain	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
there	1
appeared	1
before	1
him	1
beyond	1
a	1
projecting	1
point	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
rounded	1
the	1
flickering	1
light	1
from	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
lantern	1
alexander	1
paulvitch	1
could	1
scarce	1
restrain	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
triumph	1
the	1
kincaid	1
had	1
not	1
departed	1
life	1
and	1
vengeance	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
elude	1
him	1
after	1
all	1
he	1
stopped	1
paddling	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
he	1
descried	1
the	1
gleaming	1
beacon	1
of	1
hope	1
ahead	1
of	1
him	1
silently	1
he	1
drifted	1
down	1
the	1
muddy	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
ugambi	1
occasionally	1
dipping	1
his	1
paddle	1
s	1
blade	1
gently	1
into	1
the	1
current	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
guide	1
his	1
primitive	1
craft	1
to	1
the	1
vessel	1
s	1
side	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
more	1
closely	1
the	1
dark	1
bulk	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
loomed	1
before	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
no	1
sound	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
vessel	1
s	1
deck	1
paulvitch	1
drifted	1
unseen	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
side	1
only	1
the	1
momentary	1
scraping	1
of	1
his	1
canoe	1
s	1
nose	1
against	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
planking	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
trembling	1
with	1
nervous	1
excitement	1
the	1
russian	1
remained	1
motionless	1
for	1
several	1
minutes	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sound	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
bulk	1
above	1
him	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
his	1
coming	1
had	1
been	1
noted	1
stealthily	1
he	1
worked	1
his	1
craft	1
forward	1
until	1
the	1
stays	1
of	1
the	1
bowsprit	1
were	1
directly	1
above	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
just	1
reach	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
canoe	1
fast	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
but	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
raised	1
himself	1
quietly	1
aloft	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
dropped	1
softly	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
hideous	1
pack	1
which	1
tenanted	1
the	1
ship	1
induced	1
cold	1
tremors	1
along	1
the	1
spine	1
of	1
the	1
cowardly	1
prowler	1
but	1
life	1
itself	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
venture	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
enabled	1
to	1
steel	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
frightful	1
chances	1
which	1
lay	1
before	1
him	1
no	1
sound	1
or	1
sign	1
of	1
watch	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
deck	1
paulvitch	1
crept	1
stealthily	1
toward	1
the	1
forecastle	1
all	1
was	1
silence	1
the	1
hatch	1
was	1
raised	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
peered	1
downward	1
he	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
crew	1
reading	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
smoky	1
lantern	1
depending	1
from	1
the	1
ceiling	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
s	1
quarters	1
paulvitch	1
knew	1
the	1
man	1
well	1
a	1
surly	1
cut	1
throat	1
upon	1
whom	1
he	1
figured	1
strongly	1
in	1
the	1
carrying	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
conceived	1
gently	1
the	1
russ	1
lowered	1
himself	1
through	1
the	1
aperture	1
to	1
the	1
rounds	1
of	1
the	1
ladder	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
forecastle	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
reading	1
man	1
ready	1
to	1
warn	1
him	1
to	1
silence	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
discovered	1
him	1
but	1
so	1
deeply	1
immersed	1
was	1
the	1
sailor	1
in	1
the	1
magazine	1
that	1
the	1
russian	1
came	1
unobserved	1
to	1
the	1
forecastle	1
floor	1
there	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
whispered	1
the	1
reader	1
s	1
name	1
the	1
man	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
magazine	1
eyes	1
that	1
went	1
wide	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
familiar	1
countenance	1
of	1
rokoff	1
s	1
lieutenant	1
only	1
to	1
narrow	1
instantly	1
in	1
a	1
scowl	1
of	1
disapproval	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
ejaculated	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
we	1
all	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
done	1
for	1
and	1
gone	1
where	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago	1
his	1
lordship	1
will	1
be	1
mighty	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
paulvitch	1
crossed	1
to	1
the	1
sailor	1
s	1
side	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
lips	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
extended	1
in	1
greeting	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
other	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
dear	1
and	1
long	1
lost	1
friend	1
the	1
sailor	1
ignored	1
the	1
proffered	1
hand	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
return	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
smile	1
i	1
ve	1
come	1
to	1

rid	1
of	1
the	1

there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
danger	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
when	1
we	1
get	1
back	1
to	1

in	1
on	1
them	1
while	1
they	1
sleep	1
that	1

greystoke	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
that	1
black	1
scoundrel	1
mugambi	1
afterward	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
simple	1
matter	1
to	1
clean	1
up	1
the	1
beasts	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
they	1
re	1

replied	1
the	1
sailor	1
but	1
just	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
paulvitch	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1

no	1
more	1
show	1
to	1
turn	1
us	1
men	1
against	1

than	1
nothing	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
we	1
wanted	1
of	1

dead	1
too	1
before	1

like	1

and	1
if	1
you	1

any	1

you	1

it	1
you	1

to	1

that	1
you	1
re	1
going	1
to	1
turn	1
against	1
me	1
demanded	1
paulvitch	1
the	1
other	1
nodded	1
and	1
then	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
pause	1
during	1
which	1
an	1
idea	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
spoke	1
again	1
unless	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
can	1
make	1
it	1
worth	1
my	1
while	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
before	1
the	1
englishman	1
finds	1
you	1
here	1
you	1
wouldn	1
t	1
turn	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1

would	1
you	1
asked	1
paulvitch	1
why	1
i	1
d	1

of	1

was	1
just	1
tools	1
see	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
russian	1
pleaded	1
or	1
threatened	1
as	1
the	1
mood	1
seized	1
him	1
sometimes	1
he	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
was	1
promising	1
his	1
listener	1
either	1
fabulous	1
rewards	1
or	1
condign	1
punishment	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
obdurate	1
condign	1
of	1
equal	1
value	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
plain	1
to	1
the	1
russian	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
two	1
plans	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
either	1
he	1
must	1
consent	1
to	1
being	1
turned	1
over	1
immediately	1
to	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
or	1
he	1
must	1
pay	1
to	1
the	1
sailor	1
as	1
a	1
price	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
kincaid	1
unmolested	1
every	1

of	1

the	1

may	1
change	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
here	1
after	1
all	1
now	1
paulvitch	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
permitting	1
himself	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
avoid	1
it	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
appalled	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
infinitely	1
preferable	1
to	1
the	1
certain	1
death	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
merited	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
is	1
anyone	1
sleeping	1
in	1
my	1
cabin	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
sailor	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
no	1
he	1
said	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
greystoke	1

yours	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
get	1
my	1
valuables	1

said	1
paulvitch	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
try	1
any	1
funny	1
business	1
said	1
the	1
sailor	1
and	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
russian	1
up	1
the	1
ladder	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
at	1
the	1
cabin	1
entrance	1
the	1
sailor	1
halted	1
to	1
watch	1
permitting	1
paulvitch	1
to	1
go	1
alone	1
to	1
his	1
cabin	1
here	1
he	1
gathered	1
together	1
his	1
few	1
belongings	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
buy	1
him	1
the	1
uncertain	1
safety	1
of	1
escape	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
piled	1
them	1
he	1
searched	1
his	1
brain	1
for	1
some	1
feasible	1
plan	1
either	1
to	1
ensure	1
his	1
safety	1
or	1
to	1
bring	1
revenge	1
upon	1
his	1
enemies	1
and	1
presently	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
there	1
recurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
the	1
little	1
black	1
box	1
which	1
lay	1
hidden	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
receptacle	1
beneath	1
a	1
false	1
top	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
his	1
hand	1
rested	1
the	1
russian	1
s	1
face	1
lighted	1
to	1
a	1
sinister	1
gleam	1
of	1
malevolent	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
he	1
stooped	1
and	1
felt	1
beneath	1
the	1
table	1
top	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
he	1
withdrew	1
from	1
its	1
hiding	1
place	1
the	1
thing	1
he	1
sought	1
he	1
had	1
lighted	1
the	1
lantern	1
swinging	1
from	1
the	1
beams	1
overhead	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
to	1
collect	1
his	1
belongings	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
black	1
box	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
lamplight	1
while	1
he	1
fingered	1
at	1
the	1
clasp	1
that	1
fastened	1
its	1
lid	1
the	1
lifted	1
cover	1
revealed	1
two	1
compartments	1
within	1
the	1
box	1
in	1
one	1
was	1
a	1
mechanism	1
which	1
resembled	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
clock	1
there	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
battery	1
of	1
two	1
dry	1
cells	1
a	1
wire	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
clockwork	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
poles	1
of	1
the	1
battery	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
pole	1
through	1
the	1
partition	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
compartment	1
a	1
second	1
wire	1
returning	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
clockwork	1
whatever	1
lay	1
within	1
the	1
second	1
compartment	1
was	1
not	1
visible	1
for	1
a	1
cover	1
lay	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
sealed	1
in	1
place	1
by	1
asphaltum	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
box	1
beside	1
the	1
clockwork	1
lay	1
a	1
key	1
and	1
this	1
paulvitch	1
now	1
withdrew	1
and	1
fitted	1
to	1
the	1
winding	1
stem	1
gently	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
muffling	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
winding	1
operation	1
by	1
throwing	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
articles	1
of	1
clothing	1
over	1
the	1
box	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
listened	1
intently	1
for	1
any	1
sound	1
which	1
might	1
indicate	1
that	1
the	1
sailor	1
or	1
another	1
were	1
approaching	1
his	1
cabin	1
but	1
none	1
came	1
to	1
interrupt	1
his	1
work	1
when	1
the	1
winding	1
was	1
completed	1
the	1
russian	1
set	1
a	1
pointer	1
upon	1
a	1
small	1
dial	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
clockwork	1
then	1
he	1
replaced	1
the	1
cover	1
upon	1
the	1
black	1
box	1
and	1
returned	1
the	1
entire	1
machine	1
to	1
its	1
hiding	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
table	1
a	1
sinister	1
smile	1
curled	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
bearded	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
his	1
valuables	1
blew	1
out	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
stepped	1
from	1
his	1
cabin	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
waiting	1
sailor	1
here	1
are	1
my	1
things	1
said	1
the	1
russian	1
now	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
i	1
ll	1
first	1
take	1
a	1
look	1
in	1
your	1
pockets	1
replied	1
the	1
sailor	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
overlooked	1
some	1
trifling	1
thing	1
that	1
won	1
t	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
but	1
that	1
ll	1
come	1
in	1
mighty	1
handy	1
to	1
a	1
poor	1
sailorman	1
in	1
london	1
ah	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
feared	1
he	1
ejaculated	1
an	1
instant	1
later	1
as	1
he	1
withdrew	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
bank	1
notes	1
from	1
paulvitch	1
s	1
inside	1
coat	1
pocket	1
the	1
russian	1
scowled	1
muttering	1
an	1
imprecation	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
argument	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
loss	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
sailor	1
would	1
never	1
reach	1
london	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
his	1
thievery	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
that	1
paulvitch	1
restrained	1
a	1
consuming	1
desire	1
to	1
taunt	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
suggestion	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
that	1
would	1
presently	1
overtake	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
company	1
but	1
fearing	1
to	1
arouse	1
the	1
fellow	1
s	1
suspicions	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
deck	1
and	1
lowered	1
himself	1
in	1
silence	1
into	1
his	1
canoe	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
paddling	1
toward	1
the	1
shore	1
to	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
a	1
hideous	1
existence	1
from	1
which	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
slight	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
what	1
awaited	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
years	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
certain	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
rather	1
than	1
endure	1
it	1
the	1
sailor	1
having	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
paulvitch	1
had	1
departed	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
forecastle	1
where	1
he	1
hid	1
away	1
his	1
booty	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
his	1
bunk	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
russian	1
there	1
ticked	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
silences	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
little	1
mechanism	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
black	1
box	1
which	1
held	1
for	1
the	1
unconscious	1
sleepers	1
upon	1
the	1

the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
shortly	1
after	1
the	1
break	1
of	1
day	1
tarzan	1

on	1
deck	1
noting	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1

weather	1
the	1

had	1
abated	1
the	1

cloudless	1
every	1

seemed	1
ideal	1
for	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
return	1
voyage	1
to	1
jungle	1
island	1
where	1
the	1
beasts	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
and	1
then	1
home	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
aroused	1
the	1
mate	1
and	1
gave	1
instructions	1
that	1
the	1
kincaid	1
sail	1
at	1
the	1
earliest	1
possible	1
moment	1
the	1
remaining	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
safe	1
in	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
s	1
assurance	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
prosecuted	1
for	1
their	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
villainies	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
russians	1
hastened	1
with	1
cheerful	1
alacrity	1
to	1
their	1
several	1
duties	1
the	1
beasts	1
liberated	1
from	1
the	1
confinement	1
of	1
the	1
hold	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
deck	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
discomfiture	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
in	1
whose	1
minds	1
there	1
remained	1
a	1
still	1
vivid	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
savagery	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
in	1
conflict	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
their	1
deaths	1
beneath	1
the	1
fangs	1
and	1
talons	1
which	1
even	1
now	1
seemed	1
itching	1
for	1
the	1
soft	1
flesh	1
of	1
further	1
prey	1
beneath	1
the	1
watchful	1
eyes	1
of	1
tarzan	1
and	1
mugambi	1
however	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
curbed	1
their	1
desires	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
worked	1
about	1
the	1
deck	1
amongst	1
them	1
in	1
far	1
greater	1
security	1
than	1
they	1
imagined	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
kincaid	1
slipped	1
down	1
the	1
ugambi	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
shimmering	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
atlantic	1
tarzan	1
and	1
jane	1
clayton	1
watched	1
the	1
verdure	1
clad	1
shore	1
line	1
receding	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
wake	1
and	1
for	1
once	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
left	1
his	1
native	1
soil	1
without	1
one	1
single	1
pang	1
of	1
regret	1
no	1
ship	1
that	1
sailed	1
the	1
seven	1
seas	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
africa	1
to	1
resume	1
his	1
search	1
for	1
his	1
lost	1
boy	1
with	1
half	1
the	1
speed	1
that	1
the	1
englishman	1
would	1
have	1
desired	1
and	1
the	1
slow	1
moving	1
kincaid	1
seemed	1
scarce	1
to	1
move	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
impatient	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
bereaved	1
father	1
yet	1
the	1
vessel	1
made	1
progress	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
standing	1
still	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
low	1
hills	1
of	1
jungle	1
island	1
became	1
distinctly	1
visible	1
upon	1
the	1
western	1
horizon	1
ahead	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
of	1

ticked	1
ticked	1
ticked	1
with	1
apparently	1
unending	1
monotony	1
but	1
yet	1
second	1
by	1
second	1
a	1
little	1
arm	1
which	1
protruded	1
from	1
the	1
periphery	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
wheels	1
came	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
another	1
little	1
arm	1
which	1
projected	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
paulvitch	1
had	1
set	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
point	1
upon	1
the	1
dial	1
beside	1
the	1

the	1
herculean	1
nature	1
of	1

task	1
became	1
more	1

more	1
apparent	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
grumbling	1

die	1
quietly	1
and	1
considerately	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
certain	1
element	1
of	1
risk	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
dispute	1
the	1
issue	1
with	1
the	1
murderer	1
it	1
was	1
this	1
chance	1
of	1
dispute	1
which	1
gust	1
preferred	1
to	1
forgo	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
done	1
the	1
swede	1
aspired	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
highest	1
command	1
among	1
the	1
mutineers	1
he	1
had	1
even	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
appropriate	1
and	1
wear	1
certain	1
articles	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
murdered	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
articles	1
of	1
apparel	1
which	1
bore	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
badges	1
and	1
insignia	1
of	1
authority	1
kai	1
shang	1
was	1
peeved	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
love	1
for	1
authority	1
and	1
certainly	1
not	1
the	1
slightest	1
intention	1
of	1
submitting	1
to	1
the	1
domination	1
of	1
an	1
ordinary	1
swede	1
sailor	1
the	1
seeds	1
of	1
discontent	1
were	1
therefore	1
already	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
at	1
the	1
north	1
edge	1
of	1
jungle	1
island	1
but	1
kai	1
shang	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
act	1
with	1
circumspection	1
for	1
gust	1
alone	1
of	1
the	1
motley	1
horde	1
possessed	1
sufficient	1
knowledge	1
of	1
navigation	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
atlantic	1
and	1
around	1
the	1
cape	1
into	1
more	1
congenial	1
waters	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
a	1
market	1
for	1
their	1
ill	1
gotten	1
wealth	1
and	1
no	1
questions	1
asked	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
they	1
sighted	1
jungle	1
island	1
and	1
discovered	1
the	1
little	1
land	1
locked	1
harbour	1
upon	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
cowrie	1
now	1
rode	1
quietly	1
at	1
anchor	1
the	1
watch	1
had	1
discovered	1
the	1
smoke	1
and	1
funnels	1
of	1
a	1
warship	1
upon	1
the	1
southern	1
horizon	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
spoken	1
to	1
and	1
investigated	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
appealed	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
so	1
they	1
put	1
into	1
hiding	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
until	1
the	1
danger	1
should	1
have	1
passed	1
and	1
now	1
gust	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
venture	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
again	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
telling	1
he	1
insisted	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
was	1
actually	1
searching	1
for	1
them	1
kai	1
shang	1
pointed	1
out	1
that	1
such	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
any	1
human	1
being	1
other	1
than	1
themselves	1
to	1
have	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
transpired	1
aboard	1
the	1
cowrie	1
but	1
gust	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
in	1
his	1
wicked	1
heart	1
he	1
nursed	1
a	1
scheme	1
whereby	1
he	1
might	1
increase	1
his	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
booty	1
by	1
something	1
like	1
one	1
hundred	1
per	1
cent	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
sail	1
the	1
cowrie	1
therefore	1
the	1
others	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
jungle	1
island	1
without	1
him	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
prevent	1
gust	1
with	1
just	1
sufficient	1
men	1
to	1
man	1
the	1
schooner	1
slipping	1
away	1
from	1
kai	1
shang	1
momulla	1
the	1
maori	1
and	1
some	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
when	1
opportunity	1
presented	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
this	1
opportunity	1
that	1
gust	1
waited	1
some	1
day	1
there	1
would	1
come	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
kai	1
shang	1
momulla	1
and	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
would	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
camp	1
exploring	1
or	1
hunting	1
the	1
swede	1
racked	1
his	1
brain	1
for	1
some	1
plan	1
whereby	1
he	1
might	1
successfully	1
lure	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
anchored	1
ship	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
abandon	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
he	1
organized	1
hunting	1
party	1
after	1
hunting	1
party	1
but	1
always	1
the	1
devil	1
of	1
perversity	1
seemed	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
so	1
that	1
wily	1
celestial	1
would	1
never	1
hunt	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
gust	1
himself	1
one	1
day	1
kai	1
shang	1
spoke	1
secretly	1
with	1
momulla	1
the	1
maori	1
pouring	1
into	1
the	1
brown	1
ear	1
of	1
his	1
companion	1
the	1
suspicions	1
which	1
he	1
harboured	1
concerning	1
the	1
swede	1
momulla	1
was	1
for	1
going	1
immediately	1
and	1
running	1
a	1
long	1
knife	1
through	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
traitor	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
kai	1
shang	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
evidence	1
than	1
the	1
natural	1
cunning	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
knavish	1
soul	1
but	1
he	1
imagined	1
in	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
gust	1
what	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
accomplish	1
had	1
the	1
means	1
lain	1
at	1
hand	1
but	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
let	1
momulla	1
slay	1
the	1
swede	1
upon	1
whom	1
they	1
depended	1
to	1
guide	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
destination	1
they	1
decided	1
however	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
frighten	1
gust	1
into	1
acceding	1
to	1
their	1
demands	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
purpose	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
maori	1
sought	1
out	1
the	1
self	1
constituted	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
when	1
he	1
broached	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
immediate	1
departure	1
gust	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
former	1
objection	1
that	1
the	1
warship	1
might	1
very	1
probably	1
be	1
patrolling	1
the	1
sea	1
directly	1
in	1
their	1
southern	1
path	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
reach	1
other	1
waters	1
momulla	1
scoffed	1
at	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
his	1
fellow	1
pointing	1
out	1
that	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
aboard	1
any	1
warship	1
knew	1
of	1
their	1
mutiny	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
suspected	1
ah	1
exclaimed	1
gust	1
there	1
is	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
there	1
is	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
lucky	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
educated	1
man	1
like	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
ignorant	1
savage	1
momulla	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
wireless	1
the	1
maori	1
leaped	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
knife	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
savage	1
he	1
shouted	1
i	1
was	1
only	1
joking	1
the	1
swede	1
hastened	1
to	1
explain	1
we	1
are	1
old	1
friends	1
momulla	1
we	1
cannot	1
afford	1
to	1
quarrel	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
while	1
old	1
kai	1
shang	1
is	1
plotting	1
to	1
steal	1
all	1
the	1
pearls	1
from	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
navigate	1
the	1
cowrie	1
he	1
would	1
leave	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
all	1
his	1
talk	1
about	1
getting	1
away	1
from	1
here	1
is	1
just	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
some	1
scheme	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
us	1
but	1
the	1
wireless	1
asked	1
momulla	1
what	1
has	1
the	1
wireless	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
our	1
remaining	1
here	1
oh	1
yes	1
replied	1
gust	1
scratching	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
was	1
wondering	1
if	1
the	1
maori	1
were	1
really	1
so	1
ignorant	1
as	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
preposterous	1
lie	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
unload	1
upon	1
him	1
oh	1
yes	1
you	1
see	1
every	1
warship	1
is	1
equipped	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
a	1
wireless	1
apparatus	1
it	1
lets	1
them	1
talk	1
to	1
other	1
ships	1
hundreds	1
of	1
miles	1
away	1
and	1
it	1
lets	1
them	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
said	1
on	1
these	1
other	1
ships	1
now	1
you	1
see	1
when	1
you	1
fellows	1
were	1
shooting	1
up	1
the	1
cowrie	1
you	1
did	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
of	1
loud	1
talking	1
and	1
there	1
isn	1
t	1
any	1
doubt	1
but	1
that	1
that	1
warship	1
was	1
a	1
lyin	1
off	1
south	1
of	1
us	1
listenin	1
to	1
it	1
all	1
of	1
course	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
learned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
but	1
they	1
heard	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
crew	1
of	1
some	1
ship	1
was	1
mutinying	1
and	1
killin	1
her	1
officers	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
they	1
ll	1
be	1
waiting	1
to	1
search	1
every	1
ship	1
they	1
sight	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
away	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
the	1
swede	1
strove	1
to	1
assume	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
composure	1
that	1
his	1
listener	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
his	1
suspicions	1
aroused	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
statements	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
made	1
momulla	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
silence	1
eyeing	1
gust	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
rose	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
liar	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
ll	1
never	1
have	1
another	1
chance	1
to	1
lie	1
for	1
i	1
heard	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
d	1
like	1
to	1
run	1
a	1
knife	1
into	1
you	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
hole	1
any	1
longer	1
they	1
d	1
do	1
it	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
kai	1
shang	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wireless	1
replied	1
gust	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
and	1
that	1
vessels	1
can	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
across	1
hundreds	1
of	1
miles	1
of	1
water	1
then	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
so	1
they	1
will	1
never	1
live	1
to	1
spend	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
swag	1
for	1
only	1
i	1
can	1
get	1
you	1
safely	1
to	1
any	1
port	1
so	1
momulla	1
went	1
to	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
apparatus	1
as	1
a	1
wireless	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
ships	1
could	1
talk	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
great	1
distances	1
and	1
kai	1
shang	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
momulla	1
was	1
puzzled	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
island	1
and	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
chances	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
remain	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
if	1
we	1
only	1
had	1
someone	1
else	1
who	1
could	1
navigate	1
a	1
ship	1
wailed	1
kai	1
shang	1
that	1
afternoon	1
momulla	1
went	1
hunting	1
with	1
two	1
other	1
maoris	1
they	1
hunted	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far	1
from	1
camp	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
ahead	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
men	1
had	1
preceded	1
them	1
and	1
as	1
all	1
were	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
was	1
uninhabited	1
they	1
were	1
inclined	1
to	1
flee	1
in	1
terror	1
on	1
the	1
hypothesis	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
haunted	1
possibly	1
by	1
the	1
ghosts	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
but	1
momulla	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
curious	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
superstitious	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
quelled	1
his	1
natural	1
desire	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
supernatural	1
motioning	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
example	1
he	1
dropped	1
to	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
crawling	1
forward	1
stealthily	1
and	1
with	1
quakings	1
of	1
heart	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
unseen	1
speakers	1
presently	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
clearing	1
he	1
halted	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
breathed	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief	1
for	1
plainly	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
saw	1
two	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
men	1
sitting	1
upon	1
a	1
fallen	1
log	1
and	1
talking	1
earnestly	1
together	1
one	1
was	1
schneider	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
and	1
the	1
other	1

a	1
seaman	1
named	1
schmidt	1
i	1

schneider	1
was	1
saying	1
a	1
good	1
canoe	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
hard	1
to	1
build	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
could	1
paddle	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mainland	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
if	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
right	1

reasonably	1
calm	1

the	1

paused	1
for	1
a	1

a	1
smattering	1
of	1
every	1

that	1
is	1
spoken	1
upon	1
the	1

and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
few	1
times	1
had	1
he	1
sailed	1
on	1
english	1
ships	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
fairly	1
well	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
schneider	1
and	1
schmidt	1
since	1
he	1
had	1

upon	1
them	1

rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1

stepped	1
into	1
the	1
clearing	1
schneider	1

his	1

as	1
nervously	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
ghost	1
had	1
risen	1
before	1

schneider	1
reached	1
for	1

not	1

that	1

will	1

addressing	1

you	1
can	1
navigate	1
a	1

you	1
have	1
no	1
ship	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
ship	1

no	1
one	1
to	1
navigate	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
ask	1
no	1

we	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
take	1
the	1

you	1
will	1
after	1
you	1

landed	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
port	1
the	1

of	1
which	1
we	1

you	1

whom	1
you	1

and	1
we	1
will	1
ask	1
no	1

either	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
bargain	1
schneider	1
desired	1
more	1
information	1
and	1
got	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
momulla	1
thought	1
best	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
then	1
the	1
maori	1
suggested	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
with	1
kai	1
shang	1
the	1
two	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
company	1
followed	1
momulla	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
to	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
here	1
momulla	1
hid	1
them	1
while	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
first	1
admonishing	1
his	1
maori	1
companions	1
to	1
stand	1
guard	1
over	1
the	1
two	1
sailors	1
lest	1
they	1
change	1
their	1
minds	1
and	1
attempt	1
to	1
escape	1
schneider	1
and	1
schmidt	1
were	1
virtually	1
prisoners	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
it	1
presently	1
momulla	1
returned	1
with	1
kai	1
shang	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
briefly	1
narrated	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
chinaman	1
spoke	1
at	1
length	1
with	1
schneider	1
until	1
notwithstanding	1
his	1
natural	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
he	1
became	1
quite	1
convinced	1
that	1
schneider	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
rogue	1
as	1
himself	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
island	1
these	1
two	1
premises	1
accepted	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
schneider	1
would	1
prove	1
trustworthy	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
accepting	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
was	1
concerned	1
after	1
that	1
kai	1
shang	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
means	1
to	1
coerce	1
the	1
man	1
into	1
submission	1
to	1
his	1
further	1
wishes	1
when	1
schneider	1
and	1
schmidt	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
camp	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
feelings	1
of	1
far	1
greater	1
relief	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
experienced	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
day	1
now	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
feasible	1
plan	1
for	1
leaving	1
the	1
island	1
upon	1
a	1
seaworthy	1
craft	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
hard	1
labour	1
at	1
ship	1
building	1
and	1
no	1
risking	1
their	1
lives	1
upon	1
a	1
crudely	1
built	1
makeshift	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
mainland	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
assistance	1
in	1
capturing	1
the	1
woman	1
or	1
rather	1
women	1
for	1
when	1
momulla	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
black	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
camp	1
he	1
had	1
insisted	1
that	1
she	1
be	1
brought	1
along	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
white	1
woman	1
as	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
entered	1
their	1
camp	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
realization	1
that	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
needed	1
gust	1
they	1
marched	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
tent	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
at	1
that	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
for	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
comfortable	1
for	1
the	1
entire	1
party	1
to	1
remain	1
aboard	1
the	1
ship	1
they	1
had	1
mutually	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safer	1
for	1
all	1
concerned	1
were	1
they	1
to	1
pitch	1
their	1
camp	1
ashore	1
each	1
knew	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
was	1
sufficient	1
treachery	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
unsafe	1
for	1
any	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
to	1
go	1
ashore	1
leaving	1
the	1
others	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
so	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
men	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
were	1
ever	1
permitted	1
aboard	1
the	1
vessel	1
unless	1
all	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
was	1
there	1
too	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
crossed	1
toward	1
gust	1
s	1
tent	1
the	1
maori	1
felt	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
knife	1
with	1
one	1
grimy	1
calloused	1
thumb	1
the	1
swede	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
far	1
from	1
comfortable	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
significant	1
action	1
or	1
read	1
what	1
was	1
passing	1
amid	1
the	1
convolutions	1
of	1
the	1
brown	1
man	1
s	1
cruel	1
brain	1
now	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
gust	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
cook	1
and	1
this	1
tent	1
stood	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
of	1
course	1
dream	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
any	1
special	1
significance	1
for	1
him	1
chance	1
had	1
it	1
though	1
that	1
he	1
glanced	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
the	1
cook	1
s	1
tent	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
that	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
approached	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
his	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
noted	1
a	1
stealthiness	1
in	1
their	1
movements	1
that	1
comported	1
poorly	1
with	1
amicable	1
or	1
friendly	1
intentions	1
and	1
then	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
two	1
slunk	1
within	1
the	1
interior	1
gust	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
knife	1
which	1
momulla	1
the	1
maori	1
was	1
then	1
carrying	1
behind	1
his	1
back	1
the	1
swede	1
s	1
eyes	1
opened	1
wide	1
and	1
a	1
funny	1
little	1
sensation	1
assailed	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
hairs	1
also	1
he	1
turned	1
almost	1
white	1
beneath	1
his	1
tan	1
quite	1
precipitately	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
cook	1
s	1
tent	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
who	1
required	1
a	1
detailed	1
exposition	1
of	1
intentions	1
that	1
were	1
quite	1
all	1
too	1
obvious	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
them	1
plotting	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
could	1
navigate	1
the	1
cowrie	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
now	1
been	1
sufficient	1
assurance	1
of	1
his	1
safety	1
but	1
quite	1
evidently	1
something	1
had	1
occurred	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
quite	1
worth	1
the	1
while	1
of	1
his	1
co	1
conspirators	1
to	1
eliminate	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
pause	1
gust	1
darted	1
across	1
the	1
beach	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
uncanny	1
noises	1
that	1
were	1
indeed	1
frightful	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
its	1
recesses	1
the	1
tangled	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
mysterious	1
country	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
beach	1
but	1
if	1
gust	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
were	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
problematical	1
while	1
the	1
danger	1
that	1
menaced	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
was	1
a	1
perfectly	1
well	1
known	1
quantity	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
expressed	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
of	1
cold	1
steel	1
or	1
the	1
coil	1
of	1
a	1
light	1
rope	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
kai	1
shang	1
garrotte	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
pai	1
sha	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
alleyway	1
back	1
of	1
loo	1
kotai	1
s	1
place	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
rope	1
therefore	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
knife	1
of	1
the	1
maori	1
but	1
he	1
feared	1
them	1
both	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
remain	1
within	1
reach	1
of	1
either	1
therefore	1
he	1
chose	1
the	1
pitiless	1
jungle	1
chapter	1
21	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
tarzan	1
s	1
camp	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
threats	1
and	1
promised	1
rewards	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
had	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
the	1
hull	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
skiff	1
almost	1
completed	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
and	1
mugambi	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
hands	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
furnishing	1
the	1
camp	1
with	1
meat	1
schneider	1
the	1
mate	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
considerable	1
grumbling	1
and	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
openly	1
deserted	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
gone	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
with	1
schmidt	1
to	1
hunt	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
a	1
rest	1
and	1
tarzan	1
rather	1
than	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
which	1
already	1
made	1
camp	1
life	1
almost	1
unendurable	1
had	1
permitted	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
to	1
depart	1
without	1
a	1
remonstrance	1
upon	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
however	1
schneider	1
affected	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
remorse	1
for	1
his	1
action	1
and	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
a	1
will	1
upon	1
the	1
skiff	1
schmidt	1
also	1
worked	1
good	1
naturedly	1
and	1
lord	1
greystoke	1
congratulated	1
himself	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
awakened	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
the	1
labour	1
which	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
obligations	1
to	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
greater	1
relief	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
that	1
noon	1
to	1
hunt	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
for	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
small	1
deer	1
which	1
schneider	1
reported	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
schmidt	1
had	1
seen	1
there	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
schneider	1
had	1
reported	1
seeing	1
the	1
deer	1
was	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
west	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
point	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
swung	1
easily	1
through	1
the	1
tangled	1
verdure	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
there	1
approached	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
ill	1
featured	1
men	1
who	1
went	1
stealthily	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
as	1
go	1
men	1
bent	1
upon	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
act	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
travelled	1
unseen	1
but	1
behind	1
them	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
quitted	1
their	1
own	1
camp	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
crept	1
upon	1
their	1
trail	1
in	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
eyes	1
were	1
hate	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
curiosity	1
why	1
went	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
thus	1
stealthily	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
what	1
did	1
they	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
there	1
gust	1
shook	1
his	1
low	1
browed	1
head	1
in	1
perplexity	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
know	1
he	1
would	1
follow	1
them	1
and	1
learn	1
their	1
plans	1
and	1
then	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
thwart	1
them	1
he	1
would	1
that	1
went	1
without	1
question	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
searched	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
finally	1
his	1
better	1
judgment	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
such	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
accomplished	1
all	1
they	1
really	1
desired	1
by	1
chasing	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
camp	1
never	1
would	1
kai	1
shang	1
or	1
momulla	1
go	1
to	1
such	1
pains	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
or	1
another	1
unless	1
it	1
would	1
put	1
money	1
into	1
their	1
pockets	1
and	1
as	1
gust	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
searching	1
for	1
someone	1
else	1
presently	1
the	1
party	1
he	1
trailed	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
its	1
members	1
concealed	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
foliage	1
bordering	1
the	1
game	1
trail	1
along	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
gust	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
the	1
better	1
observe	1
clambered	1
into	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
to	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
them	1
being	1
careful	1
that	1
the	1
leafy	1
fronds	1
hid	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
erstwhile	1
mates	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
to	1
wait	1
before	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
strange	1
white	1
man	1
approach	1
carefully	1
along	1
the	1
trail	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
at	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
comer	1
momulla	1
and	1
kai	1
shang	1
arose	1
from	1
their	1
places	1
of	1
concealment	1
and	1
greeted	1
him	1
gust	1
could	1
not	1
overhear	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
then	1
the	1
man	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
he	1
was	1
schneider	1
nearing	1
his	1
camp	1
he	1
circled	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
presently	1
came	1
running	1
in	1
breathlessly	1
excitedly	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
mugambi	1
quick	1
he	1
cried	1
those	1
apes	1
of	1
yours	1
have	1
caught	1
schmidt	1
and	1
will	1
kill	1
him	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
hasten	1
to	1
his	1
aid	1
you	1
alone	1
can	1
call	1
them	1
off	1
take	1
jones	1
and	1
sullivan	1
you	1
may	1
need	1
help	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
follow	1
the	1
game	1
trail	1
south	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
i	1
will	1
remain	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
too	1
spent	1
with	1
running	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
threw	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
panting	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
done	1
for	1
mugambi	1
hesitated	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
then	1
jane	1
clayton	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
schneider	1
s	1
story	1
added	1
her	1
pleas	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
mate	1
do	1
not	1
delay	1
she	1
urged	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
here	1
mr	1
schneider	1
will	1
remain	1
with	1
us	1
go	1
mugambi	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
must	1
be	1
saved	1
schmidt	1
who	1
lay	1
hidden	1
in	1
a	1
bush	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
grinned	1
mugambi	1
heeding	1
the	1
commands	1
of	1
his	1
mistress	1
though	1
still	1
doubtful	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
his	1
action	1
started	1
off	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
with	1
jones	1
and	1
sullivan	1
at	1
his	1
heels	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
disappeared	1
than	1
schmidt	1
rose	1
and	1
darted	1
north	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
of	1
fachan	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
clearing	1
schneider	1
saw	1
the	1
chinaman	1
and	1
motioned	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
coast	1
was	1
clear	1
jane	1
clayton	1
and	1
the	1
mosula	1
woman	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
s	1
tent	1
their	1
backs	1
toward	1
the	1
approaching	1
ruffians	1
the	1
first	1
intimation	1
that	1
either	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
strangers	1
in	1
camp	1
was	1
the	1
sudden	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
half	1
dozen	1
ragged	1
villains	1
about	1
them	1
come	1
said	1
kai	1
shang	1
motioning	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
arise	1
and	1
follow	1
him	1
jane	1
clayton	1
sprang	1
to	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
for	1
schneider	1
only	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
standing	1
behind	1
the	1
newcomers	1
a	1
grin	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
stood	1
schmidt	1
instantly	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
a	1
plot	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
she	1
asked	1
addressing	1
the	1
mate	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
now	1
escape	1
from	1
jungle	1
island	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
send	1
mugambi	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
the	1
jungle	1
she	1
inquired	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
coming	1
with	1
us	1
only	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
and	1
the	1
mosula	1
woman	1
come	1
repeated	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
seized	1
jane	1
clayton	1
s	1
wrist	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maoris	1
grasped	1
the	1
black	1
woman	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
screamed	1
struck	1
her	1
across	1
the	1
mouth	1
mugambi	1
raced	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
jones	1
and	1
sullivan	1
trailed	1
far	1
behind	1
for	1
a	1
mile	1
he	1
continued	1
upon	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
schmidt	1
but	1
no	1
signs	1
saw	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
man	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
halted	1
and	1
called	1
aloud	1
the	1
summons	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
tarzan	1
had	1
used	1
to	1
hail	1
the	1
great	1
anthropoids	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
response	1
jones	1
and	1
sullivan	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
black	1
warrior	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
stood	1
voicing	1
his	1
weird	1
call	1
for	1
another	1
half	1
mile	1
the	1
black	1
searched	1
calling	1
occasionally	1
finally	1
the	1
truth	1
flashed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
like	1
a	1
frightened	1
deer	1
he	1
wheeled	1
and	1
dashed	1
back	1
toward	1
camp	1
arriving	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
full	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
fears	1
was	1
impressed	1
upon	1
him	1
lady	1
greystoke	1
and	1
the	1
mosula	1
woman	1
were	1
gone	1
so	1
likewise	1
was	1
schneider	1
when	1
jones	1
and	1
sullivan	1
joined	1
mugambi	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
anger	1
thinking	1
them	1
parties	1
to	1
the	1
plot	1
but	1
they	1
finally	1
succeeded	1
in	1
partially	1
convincing	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
speculating	1
upon	1
the	1
probable	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
their	1
abductor	1
and	1
the	1
purpose	1
which	1
schneider	1
had	1
in	1
mind	1
in	1
taking	1
them	1
from	1
camp	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
swung	1
from	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
crossed	1
the	1
clearing	1
toward	1
them	1
his	1
keen	1
eyes	1
detected	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
radically	1
wrong	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
mugambi	1
s	1
story	1
his	1
jaws	1
clicked	1
angrily	1
together	1
as	1
he	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows	1
in	1
thought	1
what	1
could	1
the	1
mate	1
hope	1
to	1
accomplish	1
by	1
taking	1
jane	1
clayton	1
from	1
a	1
camp	1
upon	1
a	1
small	1
island	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
tarzan	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
the	1
fellow	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
slight	1
realization	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
dawned	1
upon	1
him	1
schneider	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
committed	1
such	1
an	1
act	1
unless	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
reasonably	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
quit	1
jungle	1
island	1
with	1
his	1
prisoners	1
but	1
why	1
had	1
he	1
taken	1
the	1
black	1
woman	1
as	1
well	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
others	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
wanted	1
the	1
dusky	1
female	1
come	1
said	1
tarzan	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
trail	1
as	1
he	1
finished	1
speaking	1
a	1
tall	1
ungainly	1
figure	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
north	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
he	1
came	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
men	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
entire	1
stranger	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
dreamed	1
that	1
another	1
human	1
being	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
camp	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
unfriendly	1
shores	1
of	1
jungle	1
island	1
it	1
was	1
gust	1
he	1
came	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
your	1
women	1
were	1
stolen	1
he	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
ever	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
come	1
quickly	1
and	1
follow	1
me	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
hurry	1
the	1
cowrie	1
will	1
be	1
standing	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
we	1
reach	1
her	1
anchorage	1
who	1
are	1
you	1
asked	1
tarzan	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
theft	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
black	1
woman	1
i	1
heard	1
kai	1
shang	1
and	1
momulla	1
the	1
maori	1
plot	1
with	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
your	1
camp	1
they	1
had	1
chased	1
me	1
from	1
our	1
camp	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
me	1
now	1
i	1
will	1
get	1
even	1
with	1
them	1
come	1
gust	1
led	1
the	1
four	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
camp	1
at	1
a	1
rapid	1
trot	1
through	1
the	1
jungle	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
would	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
time	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
minutes	1
would	1
answer	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
party	1
did	1
break	1
through	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
screening	1
foliage	1
and	1
the	1
harbour	1
and	1
the	1
ocean	1
lay	1
before	1
them	1
they	1
realized	1
that	1
fate	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
cruelly	1
unkind	1
for	1
the	1
cowrie	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
sail	1
and	1
moving	1
slowly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
to	1
do	1
tarzan	1
s	1
broad	1
chest	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
his	1
pent	1
emotions	1
the	1
last	1
blow	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
and	1
if	1
ever	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
tarzan	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
had	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
abandon	1
hope	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
ship	1
bearing	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
some	1
frightful	1
fate	1
moving	1
gracefully	1
over	1
the	1
rippling	1
water	1
so	1
very	1
near	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
hideously	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
silence	1
he	1
stood	1
watching	1
the	1
vessel	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
turn	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
finally	1
disappear	1
around	1
a	1
headland	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
then	1
he	1
dropped	1
upon	1
his	1
haunches	1
and	1
buried	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
it	1
was	1
after	1
dark	1
that	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
shore	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
hot	1
and	1
sultry	1
no	1
slightest	1
breeze	1
ruffled	1
the	1
foliage	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
or	1
rippled	1
the	1
mirror	1
like	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
only	1
a	1
gentle	1
swell	1
rolled	1
softly	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
never	1
had	1
tarzan	1
seen	1
the	1
great	1
atlantic	1
so	1
ominously	1
at	1
peace	1
he	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
beach	1
gazing	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
mainland	1
his	1
mind	1
filled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
hopelessness	1
when	1
from	1
the	1
jungle	1
close	1
behind	1
the	1
camp	1
came	1
the	1
uncanny	1
wail	1
of	1
a	1
panther	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
familiar	1
note	1
in	1
the	1
weird	1
cry	1
and	1
almost	1
mechanically	1
tarzan	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
answered	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
tawny	1
figure	1
of	1
sheeta	1
slunk	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
half	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
beach	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
moon	1
but	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
brilliant	1
with	1
stars	1
silently	1
the	1
savage	1
brute	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
since	1
tarzan	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
old	1
fighting	1
companion	1
but	1
the	1
soft	1
purr	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
animal	1
still	1
recalled	1
the	1
bonds	1
which	1
had	1
united	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
let	1
his	1
fingers	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
beast	1
s	1
coat	1
and	1
as	1
sheeta	1
pressed	1
close	1
against	1
his	1
leg	1
he	1
caressed	1
and	1
fondled	1
the	1
wicked	1
head	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
continued	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
presently	1
he	1
started	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
strained	1
his	1
eyes	1
into	1
the	1
night	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
called	1
aloud	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
smoking	1
upon	1
their	1
blankets	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
they	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
but	1
gust	1
hesitated	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
tarzan	1
s	1
companion	1
look	1
cried	1
tarzan	1
a	1
light	1
a	1
ship	1
s	1
light	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
cowrie	1
they	1
are	1
becalmed	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
renewed	1
hope	1
we	1
can	1
reach	1
them	1
the	1
skiff	1
will	1
carry	1
us	1
easily	1

well	1

warned	1
we	1

not	1

the	1

just	1
five	1
of	1
us	1
there	1
are	1
six	1
now	1
replied	1
tarzan	1
pointing	1
to	1
sheeta	1

in	1
a	1
half	1

raised	1
his	1

toward	1
the	1
jungle	1
while	1
there	1
pealed	1
from	1
his	1
lips	1

the	1
fearsome	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1

would	1
summon	1
his	1

presently	1
from	1
the	1

came	1
an	1
answering	1
cry	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
and	1
another	1

called	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
jungle	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
came	1
crashing	1
through	1
the	1
underbrush	1
and	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
struggling	1
with	1
the	1
unwieldy	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
skiff	1
s	1
hull	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
herculean	1
efforts	1
they	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
water	1

from	1
the	1

were	1
hastily	1
requisitioned	1

by	1
the	1

came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1

all	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
embarkation	1
once	1
again	1
the	1
hideous	1
crew	1
entered	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
without	1
question	1
took	1
up	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
skiff	1
the	1
four	1
men	1
for	1
gust	1
could	1

to	1

using	1
them	1
paddle	1
wise	1
while	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
apes	1
followed	1
their	1
example	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
ungainly	1
skiff	1
was	1
moving	1
quietly	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
gently	1
with	1
the	1
swell	1
a	1
sleepy	1
sailor	1
kept	1
a	1
poor	1
vigil	1
upon	1
the	1
cowrie	1
s	1
deck	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
cabin	1
below	1
schneider	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
arguing	1
with	1
jane	1
clayton	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
revolver	1
in	1
a	1
table	1
drawer	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
locked	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
kept	1
the	1
mate	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
at	1
bay	1
with	1
the	1
weapon	1
the	1
mosula	1
woman	1
kneeled	1
behind	1
her	1
while	1
schneider	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
threatening	1
and	1
pleading	1
and	1
promising	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
avail	1
presently	1
from	1
the	1
deck	1
above	1
came	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
warning	1
and	1
a	1
shot	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
jane	1
clayton	1
relaxed	1
her	1
vigilance	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
toward	1
the	1
cabin	1
skylight	1
simultaneously	1
schneider	1
was	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
first	1
intimation	1
the	1
watch	1
had	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
craft	1
within	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
came	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
poked	1
over	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
side	1
instantly	1
the	1
fellow	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
levelled	1
his	1
revolver	1
at	1
the	1
intruder	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
cry	1
and	1
the	1
subsequent	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
revolver	1
which	1
threw	1
jane	1
clayton	1
off	1
her	1
guard	1
upon	1
deck	1
the	1
quiet	1
of	1
fancied	1
security	1
soon	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
wildest	1
pandemonium	1
the	1
crew	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
rushed	1
above	1
armed	1
with	1
revolvers	1
cutlasses	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
knives	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
habitually	1
wore	1
but	1
the	1
alarm	1
had	1
come	1
too	1
late	1
already	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
tarzan	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
ship	1
s	1
deck	1
with	1
tarzan	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
kincaid	1
s	1
crew	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
frightful	1
beasts	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
mutineers	1
wavered	1
and	1
broke	1
those	1
with	1
revolvers	1
fired	1
a	1
few	1
scattering	1
shots	1
and	1
then	1
raced	1
for	1
some	1
place	1
of	1
supposed	1
safety	1
into	1
the	1
shrouds	1
went	1
some	1
but	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
were	1
more	1
at	1
home	1
there	1
than	1
they	1
screaming	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
maoris	1
were	1
dragged	1
from	1
their	1
lofty	1
perches	1
the	1
beasts	1
uncontrolled	1
by	1
tarzan	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
jane	1
loosed	1
the	1
full	1
fury	1
of	1
their	1
savage	1
natures	1
upon	1
the	1
unhappy	1
wretches	1
who	1
fell	1
into	1
their	1
clutches	1
sheeta	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
had	1
felt	1
his	1
great	1
fangs	1
sink	1
into	1
but	1
a	1
single	1
jugular	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
mauled	1
the	1
corpse	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
spied	1
kai	1
shang	1
darting	1
down	1
the	1
companionway	1
toward	1
his	1
cabin	1
with	1
a	1
shrill	1
scream	1
sheeta	1
was	1
after	1
him	1
a	1
scream	1
which	1
awoke	1
an	1
almost	1
equally	1
uncanny	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
the	1
terror	1
stricken	1
chinaman	1
but	1
kai	1
shang	1
reached	1
his	1
cabin	1
a	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
panther	1
and	1
leaping	1
within	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
just	1
too	1
late	1
sheeta	1
s	1
great	1
body	1
hurtled	1
against	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
catch	1
engaged	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
kai	1
shang	1
was	1
gibbering	1
and	1
shrieking	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
upper	1
berth	1
lightly	1
sheeta	1
sprang	1
after	1
his	1
victim	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
wicked	1
days	1
of	1
kai	1
shang	1
of	1
fachan	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
sheeta	1
was	1
gorging	1
himself	1
upon	1
tough	1
and	1
stringy	1
flesh	1
a	1
moment	1
scarcely	1
had	1
elapsed	1
after	1
schneider	1
leaped	1
upon	1
jane	1
clayton	1
and	1
wrenched	1
the	1
revolver	1
from	1
her	1
hand	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
cabin	1
opened	1
and	1
a	1
tall	1
and	1
half	1
naked	1
white	1
man	1
stood	1
framed	1
within	1
the	1
portal	1
silently	1
he	1
leaped	1
across	1
the	1
cabin	1
schneider	1
felt	1
sinewy	1
fingers	1
at	1
his	1
throat	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
had	1
attacked	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
went	1
wide	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
close	1
above	1
his	1
own	1
grimly	1
the	1
fingers	1
tightened	1
upon	1
the	1
mate	1
s	1
throat	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
scream	1
to	1
plead	1
but	1
no	1
sound	1
came	1
forth	1
his	1
eyes	1
protruded	1
as	1
he	1
struggled	1
for	1
freedom	1
for	1
breath	1
for	1
life	1
jane	1
clayton	1
seized	1
her	1
husband	1
s	1
hands	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
drag	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
but	1
tarzan	1
only	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
not	1
again	1
he	1
said	1
quietly	1
before	1
have	1
i	1
permitted	1
scoundrels	1
to	1
live	1
only	1
to	1
suffer	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
mercy	1
this	1
time	1
we	1
shall	1
make	1
sure	1
of	1
one	1
scoundrel	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
again	1
harm	1
us	1
or	1
another	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
wrench	1
he	1
twisted	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
perfidious	1
mate	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sharp	1
crack	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
s	1
body	1
lay	1
limp	1
and	1
motionless	1
in	1
the	1
ape	1
man	1
s	1
grasp	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
disgust	1
tarzan	1
tossed	1
the	1
corpse	1
aside	1
then	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
deck	1
followed	1
by	1
jane	1
and	1
the	1
mosula	1
woman	1
the	1

there	1
was	1
over	1
schmidt	1

and	1
two	1
others	1
alone	1
remained	1
alive	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
cowrie	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
sanctuary	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
died	1
horribly	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
deserved	1
beneath	1
the	1
fangs	1
and	1
talons	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
tarzan	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
on	1
a	1
grisly	1
sight	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
of	1
the	1
unhappy	1
cowrie	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
stained	1
her	1
white	1
planking	1
was	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
guilty	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
innocent	1
tarzan	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
forecastle	1
and	1
without	1
promises	1
of	1
immunity	1
from	1
punishment	1
forced	1
them	1
to	1
help	1
work	1
the	1
vessel	1

alternative	1

immediate	1
death	1
a	1
stiff	1
breeze	1

risen	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
with	1
canvas	1
spread	1
the	1
cowrie	1
set	1
in	1
toward	1
jungle	1
island	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
later	1
tarzan	1
picked	1
up	1
gust	1
and	1
bid	1
farewell	1
to	1
sheeta	1
and	1
the	1
apes	1
of	1
akut	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
set	1
the	1

ashore	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
wild	1
and	1
natural	1
life	1
they	1
loved	1
so	1
well	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
lose	1
a	1

into	1
the	1

depths	1
of	1
their	1
beloved	1

that	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1

was	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
doubted	1
except	1
possibly	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
intelligent	1
akut	1
who	1
alone	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
remained	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
boat	1
drew	1
away	1
toward	1
the	1
schooner	1
carrying	1
his	1

could	1
span	1
the	1
distance	1
jane	1
and	1
tarzan	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
deck	1
saw	1
the	1
lonely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
shaggy	1
anthropoid	1
motionless	1
upon	1
the	1
surf	1
beaten	1

soon	1
got	1
in	1

it	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
london	1
that	1
they	1
learned	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
remarkable	1
chain	1
of	1
circumstances	1
that	1
had	1

had	1
hidden	1
it	1
in	1

marked	1

lured	1
by	1

the	1
immense	1
ransom	1
that	1
he	1

win	1
by	1
returning	1

paulvitch	1

been	1
tempted	1
to	1
betray	1
her	1
trust	1
by	1
the	1
lure	1
of	1

so	1
had	1
opened	1

so	1
that	1
last	1

greatest	1
of	1

it	1
had	1
resulted	1

the	1
arch	1

given	1
to	1

rokoff	1
was	1
dead	1

while	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
paulvitch	1
was	1
unknown	1
they	1
had	1
every	1

to	1

that	1

succumbed	1
to	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1

they	1

him	1

thus	1
in	1
so	1

aladdin	1
did	1
not	1
mend	1
his	1
ways	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
playing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
as	1
usual	1
a	1
stranger	1
asked	1
him	1
his	1
age	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
mustapha	1
the	1
tailor	1
i	1
am	1
sir	1
replied	1
aladdin	1
but	1
he	1
died	1
a	1
long	1
while	1
ago	1
on	1
this	1
the	1
stranger	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
famous	1
african	1
magician	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
saying	1
i	1
am	1
your	1
uncle	1
and	1
knew	1
you	1
from	1
your	1
likeness	1
to	1
my	1
brother	1
go	1
to	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
i	1
am	1
coming	1
aladdin	1
ran	1
home	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
of	1
his	1
newly	1
found	1
uncle	1
indeed	1
child	1
she	1
said	1
your	1
father	1
had	1
a	1
brother	1
but	1
i	1
always	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
however	1
she	1
prepared	1
supper	1
and	1
bade	1
aladdin	1
seek	1
his	1
uncle	1
who	1
came	1
laden	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
fruit	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
mustapha	1
used	1
to	1
sit	1
bidding	1
aladdin	1
s	1
mother	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
seen	1
him	1
before	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
forty	1
years	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
aladdin	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
his	1
trade	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
boy	1
hung	1
his	1
head	1
while	1
his	1
mother	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
aladdin	1
was	1
idle	1
and	1
would	1
learn	1
no	1
trade	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
shop	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
stock	1
it	1
with	1
merchandise	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
bought	1
aladdin	1
a	1
fine	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
city	1
showing	1
him	1
the	1
sights	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
home	1
at	1
nightfall	1
to	1
his	1
mother	1
who	1
was	1
overjoyed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
son	1
so	1
fine	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
magician	1
led	1
aladdin	1
into	1
some	1
beautiful	1
gardens	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
outside	1
the	1
city	1
gates	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
fountain	1
and	1
the	1
magician	1
pulled	1
a	1
cake	1
from	1
his	1
girdle	1
which	1
he	1
divided	1
between	1
them	1
then	1
they	1
journeyed	1
onwards	1
till	1
they	1
almost	1
reached	1
the	1
mountains	1
aladdin	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
but	1
the	1
magician	1
beguiled	1
him	1
with	1
pleasant	1
stories	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
on	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
two	1
mountains	1
divided	1
by	1
a	1
narrow	1
valley	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
no	1
farther	1
said	1
his	1
uncle	1
i	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
something	1
wonderful	1
only	1
do	1
you	1
gather	1
up	1
sticks	1
while	1
i	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
lit	1
the	1
magician	1
threw	1
on	1
it	1
a	1
powder	1
he	1
had	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
saying	1
some	1
magical	1
words	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
disclosing	1
a	1
square	1
flat	1
stone	1
with	1
a	1
brass	1
ring	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
to	1
raise	1
it	1
by	1
aladdin	1
tried	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
but	1
the	1
magician	1
caught	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
blow	1
that	1
knocked	1
him	1
down	1
what	1
have	1
i	1
done	1
uncle	1
he	1
said	1
piteously	1
whereupon	1
the	1
magician	1
said	1
more	1
kindly	1
fear	1
nothing	1
but	1
obey	1
me	1
beneath	1
this	1
stone	1
lies	1
a	1
treasure	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
yours	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
may	1
touch	1
it	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
do	1
exactly	1
as	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
treasure	1
aladdin	1
forgot	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
grasped	1
the	1
ring	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
saying	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
grandfather	1
the	1
stone	1
came	1
up	1
quite	1
easily	1
and	1
some	1
steps	1
appeared	1
go	1
down	1
said	1
the	1
magician	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
those	1
steps	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
an	1
open	1
door	1
leading	1
into	1
three	1
large	1
halls	1
tuck	1
up	1
your	1
gown	1
and	1
go	1
through	1
them	1
without	1
touching	1
anything	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
die	1
instantly	1
these	1
halls	1
lead	1
into	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
fine	1
fruit	1
trees	1
walk	1
on	1
till	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
niche	1
in	1
a	1
terrace	1
where	1
stands	1
a	1
lighted	1
lamp	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
oil	1
it	1
contains	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
me	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
aladdin	1
bidding	1
him	1
prosper	1
aladdin	1
found	1
everything	1
as	1
the	1
magician	1
had	1
said	1
gathered	1
some	1
fruit	1
off	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
having	1
got	1
the	1
lamp	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
the	1
magician	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
lamp	1
this	1
aladdin	1
refused	1
to	1
do	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
the	1
magician	1
flew	1
into	1
a	1
terrible	1
passion	1
and	1
throwing	1
some	1
more	1
powder	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
he	1
said	1
something	1
and	1
the	1
stone	1
rolled	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
place	1
the	1
man	1
left	1
the	1
country	1
which	1
plainly	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
uncle	1
of	1
aladdin	1
s	1
but	1
a	1
cunning	1
magician	1
who	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
magic	1
books	1
of	1
a	1
wonderful	1
lamp	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
though	1
he	1
alone	1
knew	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
receive	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
another	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
out	1
the	1
foolish	1
aladdin	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
intending	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
kill	1
him	1
afterwards	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
aladdin	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
crying	1
and	1
lamenting	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
clasped	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
rubbed	1
the	1
ring	1
which	1
the	1
magician	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
immediately	1
an	1
enormous	1
and	1
frightful	1
genie	1
rose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
saying	1
what	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
and	1
will	1
obey	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
aladdin	1
fearlessly	1
replied	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
place	1
whereupon	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
outside	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
could	1
bear	1
the	1
light	1
he	1
went	1
home	1
but	1
fainted	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
and	1
showed	1
her	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
fruits	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
reality	1
precious	1
stones	1
he	1
then	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
food	1
alas	1
child	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
have	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
but	1
i	1
have	1
spun	1
a	1
little	1
cotton	1
and	1
will	1
go	1
sell	1
it	1
aladdin	1
bade	1
her	1
keep	1
her	1
cotton	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
sell	1
the	1
lamp	1
instead	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
dirty	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
rub	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
fetch	1
a	1
higher	1
price	1
instantly	1
a	1
hideous	1
genie	1
appeared	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
she	1
fainted	1
away	1
but	1
aladdin	1
snatching	1
the	1
lamp	1
said	1
boldly	1
fetch	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
genie	1
returned	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
bowl	1
twelve	1
silver	1
plates	1
containing	1
rich	1
meats	1
two	1
silver	1
cups	1
and	1
two	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine	1
aladdin	1
s	1
mother	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
herself	1
said	1
whence	1
comes	1
this	1
splendid	1
feast	1
ask	1
not	1
but	1
eat	1
replied	1
aladdin	1
so	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
breakfast	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
dinner	1
time	1
and	1
aladdin	1
told	1
his	1
mother	1
about	1
the	1
lamp	1
she	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
sell	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
devils	1
no	1
said	1
aladdin	1
since	1
chance	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
aware	1
of	1
its	1
virtues	1
we	1
will	1
use	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
ring	1
likewise	1
which	1
i	1
shall	1
always	1
wear	1
on	1
my	1
finger	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
all	1
the	1
genie	1
had	1
brought	1
aladdin	1
sold	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
silver	1
plates	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
until	1
none	1
were	1
left	1
he	1
then	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
genie	1
who	1
gave	1
him	1
another	1
set	1
of	1
plates	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
lived	1
many	1
years	1
one	1
day	1
aladdin	1
heard	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
the	1
sultan	1
proclaimed	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
close	1
his	1
shutters	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
his	1
daughter	1
went	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bath	1
aladdin	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
difficult	1
as	1
she	1
always	1
went	1
veiled	1
he	1
hid	1
himself	1
behind	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
bath	1
and	1
peeped	1
through	1
a	1
chink	1
the	1
princess	1
lifted	1
her	1
veil	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
looked	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
aladdin	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
he	1
went	1
home	1
so	1
changed	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
frightened	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
princess	1
so	1
deeply	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
her	1
and	1
meant	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
his	1
mother	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
but	1
aladdin	1
at	1
last	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
the	1
sultan	1
and	1
carry	1
his	1
request	1
she	1
fetched	1
a	1
napkin	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
magic	1
fruits	1
from	1
the	1
enchanted	1
garden	1
which	1
sparkled	1
and	1
shone	1
like	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
jewels	1
she	1
took	1
these	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
please	1
the	1
sultan	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
trusting	1
in	1
the	1
lamp	1
the	1
grand	1
vizier	1
and	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
council	1
had	1
just	1
gone	1
in	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
placed	1
herself	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
sultan	1
he	1
however	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
went	1
every	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
when	1
the	1
council	1
broke	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
the	1
sultan	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
vizier	1
i	1
see	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
chamber	1
every	1
day	1
carrying	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
napkin	1
call	1
her	1
next	1
time	1
that	1
i	1
may	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
wants	1
next	1
day	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
the	1
vizier	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
remained	1
kneeling	1
until	1
the	1
sultan	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
rise	1
good	1
woman	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
she	1
hesitated	1
so	1
the	1
sultan	1
sent	1
away	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
vizier	1
and	1
bade	1
her	1
speak	1
freely	1
promising	1
to	1
forgive	1
her	1
beforehand	1
for	1
anything	1
she	1
might	1
say	1
she	1
then	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
s	1
violent	1
love	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
i	1
prayed	1
him	1
to	1
forget	1
her	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
in	1
vain	1
he	1
threatened	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
desperate	1
deed	1
if	1
i	1
refused	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
your	1
majesty	1
for	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
now	1
i	1
pray	1
you	1
to	1
forgive	1
not	1
me	1
alone	1
but	1
my	1
son	1
aladdin	1
the	1
sultan	1
asked	1
her	1
kindly	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
napkin	1
whereupon	1
she	1
unfolded	1
the	1
jewels	1
and	1
presented	1
them	1
he	1
was	1
thunderstruck	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
vizier	1
said	1
what	1
sayest	1
thou	1
ought	1
i	1
not	1
to	1
bestow	1
the	1
princess	1
on	1
one	1
who	1
values	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
price	1
the	1
vizier	1
who	1
wanted	1
her	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
begged	1
the	1
sultan	1
to	1
withhold	1
her	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
hoped	1
his	1
son	1
could	1
contrive	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
richer	1
present	1
the	1
sultan	1
granted	1
this	1
and	1
told	1
aladdin	1
s	1
mother	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
marriage	1
she	1
must	1
not	1
appear	1
before	1
him	1
again	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
aladdin	1
waited	1
patiently	1
for	1
nearly	1
three	1
months	1
but	1
after	1
two	1
had	1
elapsed	1
his	1
mother	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
buy	1
oil	1
found	1
everyone	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
grand	1
vizier	1
is	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
sultan	1
s	1
daughter	1
tonight	1
breathless	1
she	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
aladdin	1
who	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
at	1
first	1
but	1
presently	1
bethought	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
he	1
rubbed	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
genie	1
appeared	1
saying	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
will	1
aladdin	1
replied	1
the	1
sultan	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest	1
has	1
broken	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
vizier	1
s	1
son	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
princess	1
my	1
command	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
night	1
you	1
bring	1
hither	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
master	1
i	1
obey	1
said	1
the	1
genie	1
aladdin	1
then	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
chamber	1
where	1
sure	1
enough	1
at	1
midnight	1
the	1
genie	1
transported	1
the	1
bed	1
containing	1
the	1
vizier	1
s	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
take	1
this	1
new	1
married	1
man	1
he	1
said	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
return	1
at	1
daybreak	1
whereupon	1
the	1
genie	1
took	1
the	1
vizier	1
s	1
son	1
out	1
of	1
bed	1
leaving	1
aladdin	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
fear	1
nothing	1
aladdin	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
wife	1
promised	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
your	1
unjust	1
father	1
and	1
no	1
harm	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
princess	1
was	1
too	1
frightened	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
night	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
while	1
aladdin	1
lay	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
and	1
slept	1
soundly	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
the	1
genie	1
fetched	1
in	1
the	1
shivering	1
bridegroom	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
transported	1
the	1
bed	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
presently	1
the	1
sultan	1
came	1
to	1
wish	1
his	1
daughter	1
good	1
morning	1
the	1
unhappy	1
vizier	1
s	1
son	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
hid	1
himself	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful	1
the	1
sultan	1
sent	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
her	1
who	1
said	1
how	1
comes	1
it	1
child	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
father	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
the	1
princess	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
how	1
during	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
bed	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
into	1
some	1
strange	1
house	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
there	1
her	1
mother	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
but	1
bade	1
her	1
rise	1
and	1
consider	1
it	1
an	1
idle	1
dream	1
the	1
following	1
night	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
and	1
next	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
princess	1
s	1
refusing	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
sultan	1
threatened	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
then	1
confessed	1
all	1
bidding	1
him	1
ask	1
the	1
vizier	1
s	1
son	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
the	1
sultan	1
told	1
the	1
vizier	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
son	1
who	1
owned	1
the	1
truth	1
adding	1
that	1
dearly	1
as	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
princess	1
he	1
had	1
rather	1
die	1
than	1
go	1
through	1
another	1
such	1
fearful	1
night	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
her	1
his	1
wish	1
was	1
granted	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
feasting	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
when	1
the	1
three	1
months	1
were	1
over	1
aladdin	1
sent	1
his	1
mother	1
to	1
remind	1
the	1
sultan	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
sultan	1
who	1
had	1
forgotten	1
aladdin	1
at	1
once	1
remembered	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
her	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
poverty	1
the	1
sultan	1
felt	1
less	1
inclined	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
asked	1
his	1
vizier	1
s	1
advice	1
who	1
counselled	1
him	1
to	1
set	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
value	1
on	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
living	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
sultan	1
than	1
turned	1
to	1
aladdin	1
s	1
mother	1
saying	1
good	1
woman	1
a	1
sultan	1
must	1
remember	1
his	1
promises	1
and	1
i	1
will	1
remember	1
mine	1
but	1
your	1
son	1
must	1
first	1
send	1
me	1
forty	1
basins	1
of	1
gold	1
brimful	1
of	1
jewels	1
carried	1
by	1
forty	1
black	1
slaves	1
led	1
by	1
as	1
many	1
white	1
ones	1
splendidly	1
dressed	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
await	1
his	1
answer	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
aladdin	1
bowed	1
low	1
and	1
went	1
home	1
thinking	1
all	1
was	1
lost	1
she	1
gave	1
aladdin	1
the	1
message	1
adding	1
he	1
may	1
wait	1
long	1
enough	1
for	1
your	1
answer	1
not	1
so	1
long	1
mother	1
as	1
you	1
think	1
her	1
son	1
replied	1
i	1
would	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
he	1
summoned	1
the	1
genie	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
the	1
eighty	1
slaves	1
arrived	1
and	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
small	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
aladdin	1
made	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
two	1
by	1
two	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
mother	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
richly	1
dressed	1
with	1
such	1
splendid	1
jewels	1
that	1
everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
basins	1
of	1
gold	1
they	1
carried	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
palace	1
and	1
after	1
kneeling	1
before	1
the	1
sultan	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
circle	1
round	1
the	1
throne	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1
crossed	1
while	1
aladdin	1
s	1
mother	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
sultan	1
he	1
hesitated	1
no	1
longer	1
but	1
said	1
good	1
woman	1
return	1
and	1
tell	1
your	1
son	1
that	1
i	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
open	1
arms	1
she	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
telling	1
aladdin	1
bidding	1
him	1
make	1
haste	1
but	1
aladdin	1
first	1
called	1
the	1
genie	1
i	1
want	1
a	1
scented	1
bath	1
he	1
said	1
a	1
richly	1
embroidered	1
habit	1
a	1
horse	1
surpassing	1
the	1
sultan	1
s	1
and	1
twenty	1
slaves	1
to	1
attend	1
me	1
besides	1
this	1
six	1

beautifully	1

on	1
my	1

and	1
lastly	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
ten	1
purses	1
no	1
sooner	1
said	1
then	1
done	1
aladdin	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
the	1
slaves	1
strewing	1
gold	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
those	1
who	1

played	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
childhood	1

grown	1
so	1
handsome	1
when	1
the	1
sultan	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
throne	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
hall	1

aladdin	1
refused	1

a	1
palace	1
fit	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
took	1
his	1

windows	1
whose	1
lattices	1
all	1
except	1
one	1
which	1

him	1
there	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
orders	1
faithfully	1
carried	1
out	1

musicians	1
with	1
trumpets	1

his	1
mother	1
at	1
her	1

and	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
hundred	1
slaves	1

was	1
charmed	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
aladdin	1
who	1
ran	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
princess	1
he	1
said	1
blame	1
your	1
beauty	1
for	1
my	1
boldness	1
if	1
i	1
have	1
displeased	1
you	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
having	1
seen	1
him	1
she	1
willingly	1
obeyed	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
after	1
the	1
wedding	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
aladdin	1
led	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
where	1
a	1
feast	1
was	1
spread	1
and	1
she	1
supped	1
with	1
him	1
after	1
which	1
they	1
danced	1
till	1
midnight	1
next	1
day	1
aladdin	1
invited	1
the	1
sultan	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
palace	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
windows	1
with	1
their	1
rubies	1
diamonds	1
and	1
emeralds	1
he	1
cried	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
world	1
s	1
wonder	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
that	1
surprises	1
me	1
was	1
it	1
by	1
accident	1
that	1
one	1
window	1
was	1
left	1
unfinished	1
no	1
sir	1
by	1
design	1
returned	1
aladdin	1
i	1
wished	1
your	1
majesty	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
finishing	1
this	1
palace	1
the	1
sultan	1
was	1
pleased	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
jewelers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
unfinished	1
window	1
and	1
bade	1
them	1
fit	1
it	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
others	1
sir	1
replied	1
their	1
spokesman	1
we	1
cannot	1
find	1
jewels	1
enough	1
the	1
sultan	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
fetched	1
which	1
they	1
soon	1
used	1
but	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
s	1
time	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
not	1
half	1
done	1
aladdin	1
knowing	1
that	1
their	1
task	1
was	1
vain	1
bade	1
them	1
undo	1
their	1
work	1
and	1
carry	1
the	1
jewels	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
genie	1
finished	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
his	1
command	1
the	1
sultan	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
jewels	1
again	1
and	1
visited	1
aladdin	1
who	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
window	1
finished	1
the	1
sultan	1
embraced	1
him	1
the	1
envious	1
vizier	1
meanwhile	1
hinting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
enchantment	1
aladdin	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
his	1
gentle	1
bearing	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
sultan	1
s	1
armies	1
and	1
won	1
several	1
battles	1
for	1
him	1
but	1
remained	1
as	1
courteous	1
as	1
before	1
and	1
lived	1
thus	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
content	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
but	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
africa	1
the	1
magician	1
remembered	1
aladdin	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
magic	1
arts	1
discovered	1
that	1
aladdin	1
instead	1
of	1
perishing	1
miserably	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
had	1
escaped	1
and	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
princess	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
great	1
honour	1
and	1
wealth	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
tailor	1
s	1
son	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
accomplished	1
this	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
travelled	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
till	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
capital	1
of	1
china	1
bent	1
on	1
aladdin	1
s	1
ruin	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
he	1
heard	1
people	1
talking	1
everywhere	1
about	1
a	1
marvelous	1
palace	1
forgive	1
my	1
ignorance	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
palace	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
prince	1
aladdin	1
s	1
palace	1
was	1
the	1
reply	1
the	1
greatest	1
wonder	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
i	1
will	1
direct	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
the	1
magician	1
thanked	1
him	1
who	1
spoke	1
and	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
palace	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
raised	1
by	1
the	1
genie	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
became	1
half	1
mad	1
with	1
rage	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
again	1
plunge	1
aladdin	1
into	1
the	1
deepest	1
poverty	1
unluckily	1
aladdin	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
hunting	1
for	1
eight	1
days	1
which	1
gave	1
the	1
magician	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
dozen	1
lamps	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
basket	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
crying	1
new	1
lamps	1
for	1

by	1
a	1
jeering	1
crowd	1
the	1
princess	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
windows	1
sent	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
noise	1
was	1
about	1
who	1
came	1
back	1
laughing	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
scolded	1
her	1
madam	1
replied	1
the	1
slave	1
who	1
can	1
help	1
laughing	1
to	1
see	1
an	1
old	1
fool	1
offering	1
to	1
exchange	1
fine	1
new	1
lamps	1
for	1
old	1
ones	1
another	1
slave	1
hearing	1
this	1
said	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
cornice	1
there	1
which	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
magic	1
lamp	1
which	1
aladdin	1
had	1
left	1
there	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
hunting	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
princess	1
not	1
knowing	1
its	1
value	1
laughingly	1
bade	1
the	1
slave	1
take	1
it	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
exchange	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
magician	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
new	1
lamp	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
snatched	1
it	1
and	1
bade	1
the	1
slave	1
take	1
her	1
choice	1
amid	1
the	1
jeers	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
little	1
he	1
cared	1
but	1
left	1
off	1
crying	1
his	1
lamps	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
gates	1
to	1
a	1
lonely	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
till	1
nightfall	1
when	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
rubbed	1
it	1
the	1
genie	1
appeared	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
magician	1
s	1
command	1
carried	1
him	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
palace	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
lonely	1
place	1
in	1
africa	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
sultan	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
towards	1
aladdin	1
s	1
palace	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
gone	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
the	1
vizier	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
the	1
vizier	1
looked	1
out	1
too	1
and	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
astonishment	1
he	1
again	1
put	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
enchantment	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
sultan	1
believed	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
thirty	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
to	1
fetch	1
aladdin	1
back	1
in	1
chains	1
they	1
met	1
him	1
riding	1
home	1
bound	1
him	1
and	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
on	1
foot	1
the	1
people	1
however	1
who	1
loved	1
him	1
followed	1
armed	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
no	1
harm	1
he	1
was	1
carried	1
before	1
the	1
sultan	1
who	1
ordered	1
the	1
executioner	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
executioner	1
made	1
aladdin	1
kneel	1
down	1
bandaged	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
scimitar	1
to	1
strike	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
vizier	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
crowd	1
had	1
forced	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
courtyard	1
and	1
were	1
scaling	1
the	1
walls	1
to	1
rescue	1
aladdin	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
executioner	1
to	1
stay	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
people	1
indeed	1
looked	1
so	1
threatening	1
that	1
the	1
sultan	1
gave	1
way	1
and	1
ordered	1
aladdin	1
to	1
be	1
unbound	1
and	1
pardoned	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
aladdin	1
now	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
false	1
wretch	1
said	1
the	1
sultan	1
come	1
hither	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
palace	1
had	1
stood	1
aladdin	1
was	1
so	1
amazed	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
where	1
is	1
your	1
palace	1
and	1
my	1
daughter	1
demanded	1
the	1
sultan	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
i	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
deeply	1
concerned	1
but	1
my	1
daughter	1
i	1
must	1
have	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
find	1
her	1
or	1
lose	1
your	1
head	1
aladdin	1
begged	1
for	1
forty	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
promising	1
if	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
suffer	1
death	1
at	1
the	1
sultan	1
s	1
pleasure	1
his	1
prayer	1
was	1
granted	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
sadly	1
from	1
the	1
sultan	1
s	1
presence	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
wandered	1
about	1
like	1
a	1
madman	1
asking	1
everyone	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
palace	1
but	1
they	1
only	1
laughed	1
and	1
pitied	1
him	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
a	1
river	1
and	1
knelt	1
down	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
prayers	1
before	1
throwing	1
himself	1
in	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
rubbed	1
the	1
ring	1
he	1
still	1
wore	1
the	1
genie	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
appeared	1
and	1
asked	1
his	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
life	1
genie	1
said	1
aladdin	1
and	1
bring	1
my	1
palace	1
back	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
said	1
the	1
genie	1
i	1
am	1
only	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
you	1
must	1
ask	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
even	1
so	1
said	1
aladdin	1
but	1
thou	1
canst	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
under	1
my	1
dear	1
wife	1
s	1
window	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
africa	1
under	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
fell	1
asleep	1
out	1
of	1
sheer	1
weariness	1
he	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lighter	1
he	1
saw	1
plainly	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
were	1
owning	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
vainly	1
wondered	1
who	1
had	1
robbed	1
him	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
morning	1
the	1
princess	1
rose	1
earlier	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
into	1
africa	1
by	1
the	1
magician	1
whose	1
company	1
she	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
endure	1
once	1
a	1
day	1
she	1
however	1
treated	1
him	1
so	1
harshly	1
that	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
live	1
there	1
altogether	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
dressing	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
women	1
looked	1
out	1
and	1
saw	1
aladdin	1
the	1
princess	1
ran	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
she	1
made	1
aladdin	1
looked	1
up	1
she	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
these	1
lovers	1
at	1
seeing	1
each	1
other	1
again	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
her	1
aladdin	1
said	1
i	1
beg	1
of	1
you	1
princess	1
in	1
god	1
s	1
name	1
before	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
anything	1
else	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
sake	1
and	1
mine	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
lamp	1
i	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
cornice	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
windows	1
when	1
i	1
went	1
a	1
hunting	1
alas	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
innocent	1
cause	1
of	1
our	1
sorrows	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
now	1
i	1
know	1
cried	1
aladdin	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
african	1
magician	1
for	1
this	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
lamp	1
he	1
carries	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
i	1
know	1
for	1
he	1
pulled	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
breast	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
he	1
wishes	1
me	1
to	1
break	1
my	1
faith	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
marry	1
him	1
saying	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
beheaded	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
s	1
command	1
he	1
is	1
forever	1
speaking	1
ill	1
of	1
you	1
but	1
i	1
only	1
reply	1
by	1
my	1
tears	1
if	1
i	1
persist	1
i	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
use	1
violence	1
aladdin	1
comforted	1
her	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
changed	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
having	1
bought	1
a	1
certain	1
powder	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
let	1
him	1
in	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
side	1
door	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
most	1
beautiful	1
dress	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
receive	1
the	1
magician	1
with	1
smiles	1
leading	1
him	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
forgotten	1
me	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
sup	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
say	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
taste	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
his	1
country	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
some	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
i	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
she	1
listened	1
carefully	1
to	1
aladdin	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
arrayed	1
herself	1
gaily	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
she	1
left	1
china	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
girdle	1
and	1
head	1
dress	1
of	1
diamonds	1
and	1
seeing	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
ever	1
received	1
the	1
magician	1
saying	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
amazement	1
i	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
aladdin	1
is	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
my	1
tears	1
will	1
not	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
i	1
am	1
resolved	1
to	1
mourn	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
have	1
therefore	1
invited	1
you	1
to	1
sup	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
i	1
am	1
tired	1
of	1
the	1
wines	1
of	1
china	1
and	1
would	1
fain	1
taste	1
those	1
of	1
africa	1
the	1
magician	1
flew	1
to	1
his	1
cellar	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
put	1
the	1
powder	1
aladdin	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
cup	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
drink	1
her	1
health	1
in	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
africa	1
handing	1
him	1
her	1
cup	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
she	1
was	1
reconciled	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
drinking	1
the	1
magician	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
speech	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
cut	1
him	1
short	1
saying	1
let	1
us	1
drink	1
first	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
afterwards	1
she	1
set	1
her	1
cup	1
to	1
her	1
lips	1
and	1
kept	1
it	1
there	1
while	1
the	1
magician	1
drained	1
his	1
to	1
the	1
dregs	1
and	1
fell	1
back	1
lifeless	1
the	1
princess	1
then	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
aladdin	1
and	1
flung	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
his	1
neck	1
but	1
aladdin	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
dead	1
magician	1
took	1
the	1
lamp	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
vest	1
and	1
bade	1
the	1
genie	1
carry	1
the	1
palace	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
china	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
her	1
chamber	1
felt	1
only	1
two	1
little	1
shocks	1
and	1
little	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
home	1
again	1
the	1
sultan	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
closet	1
mourning	1
for	1
his	1
lost	1
daughter	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
there	1
stood	1
the	1
palace	1
as	1
before	1
he	1
hastened	1
thither	1
and	1
aladdin	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
windows	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
his	1
side	1
aladdin	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
and	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
magician	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
believe	1
a	1
ten	1
days	1
feast	1
was	1
proclaimed	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
aladdin	1
might	1
now	1
live	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
peace	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
african	1
magician	1
had	1
a	1
younger	1
brother	1
who	1
was	1
if	1
possible	1
more	1
wicked	1
and	1
more	1
cunning	1
than	1
himself	1
he	1
travelled	1
to	1
china	1
to	1
avenge	1
his	1
brother	1
s	1
death	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
pious	1
woman	1
called	1
fatima	1
thinking	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
entered	1
her	1
cell	1
and	1
clapped	1
a	1
dagger	1
to	1
her	1
breast	1
telling	1
her	1
to	1
rise	1
and	1
do	1
his	1
bidding	1
on	1
pain	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
changed	1
clothes	1
with	1
her	1
coloured	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
hers	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
veil	1
and	1
murdered	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
tell	1
no	1
tales	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
aladdin	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
thinking	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
holy	1
woman	1
gathered	1
round	1
him	1
kissing	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
begging	1
his	1
blessing	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
going	1
on	1
round	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
bade	1
her	1
slave	1
look	1
out	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
ask	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
the	1
slave	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
holy	1
woman	1
curing	1
people	1
by	1
her	1
touch	1
of	1
their	1
ailments	1
whereupon	1
the	1
princess	1
who	1
had	1
long	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
fatima	1
sent	1
for	1
her	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
the	1
magician	1
offered	1
up	1
a	1
prayer	1
for	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
prosperity	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
princess	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
by	1
her	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1

the	1

fatima	1

for	1
nothing	1
better	1
consented	1
but	1
kept	1
his	1
veil	1
down	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
discovery	1
the	1
princess	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
is	1
truly	1
beautiful	1
said	1
the	1
false	1
fatima	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
wants	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
if	1
only	1
a	1
roc	1
s	1
egg	1
replied	1
he	1
were	1
hung	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
dome	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
wonder	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
princess	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
roc	1
s	1
egg	1
and	1
when	1
aladdin	1
returned	1
from	1
hunting	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
ill	1
humour	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
amiss	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
was	1
spoilt	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
roc	1
s	1
egg	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
dome	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
replied	1
aladdin	1
you	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
happy	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
and	1
rubbed	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
genie	1
appeared	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
roc	1
s	1
egg	1
the	1
genie	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
terrible	1
shriek	1
that	1
the	1
hall	1
shook	1
wretch	1
he	1
cried	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
enough	1
that	1
i	1
have	1
done	1
everything	1
for	1
you	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
command	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
hang	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
dome	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
wife	1
and	1
your	1
palace	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
burnt	1
to	1
ashes	1

that	1
this	1

not	1

from	1
you	1

from	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1

magician	1
whom	1
you	1
destroyed	1
he	1
is	1
now	1

disappeared	1
aladdin	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
saying	1
his	1

that	1
the	1

fatima	1
should	1
be	1

her	1
